           Resolution No. 149                     
             Ronald Kennedy                       
      WHEREAS, Ronald Kennedy was born            
 on July 12, 1941. Family members describe        
 Ronald as a quiet youth with a serious           
 demeanor, a "can do" attitude, a wicked sense    
 of humor and a colorful personality. He was      
 always offering good advice to anyone who        
 would listen. His excitement was contagious      
 as he shared all kinds of new mechanical         
 inventions or new projects to you. He was        
 never bored or boring. If you needed him, he     
 was there. Period. When you called, he came;     
 and                                              
       WHEREAS, Ronald's parents Samuel           
 and Frances (Johnson) Kennedy cherished          
 their children: Ronald, Joyce, Katherine, Terry  
 and Gary. Ronald was the eldest of the five.     
 Ronald was nicknamed "Butch", a name many        
 feared or respected. Ronald helped a lot of      
 people in the neighborhood and across the        
 metro area. Kathy said her brother was a         
 "hero". His other sister Joyce said Ronald's     
 philosophy in life was to challenge any and      
 all obstacles with fervor always with a "can     
 do" attitude.; and                               
       WHEREAS, before Ron graduated from         
 high school at the age of 17 he enlisted in the  
 Marine Corps. He served on active duty as a      
 Mortar Shell Carrier in the Second Marine        
 Corps Division. His brother Gary re-told the     
 story of Ronald's heroism one weekend while      
 on leave in Mexico. Ronald and one of his        
 Mexican friends were both arrested in Mexico     
 but Ronald was quickly released. Ronald went     
 back to the base to get some weapons and         
 mobilize other Marines to go rescue his friend.  
 Everything worked out and his fellow Marines     
 recognized Ronald's type of loyalty and          
 heroism. Ronald served in the Marines for        
 four years and two more years in the MC          
 Reserves.                                        
       WHEREAS, Ronald grew up in a               
 political family. He helped run various political
 campaigns over a 45 year span for aldermanic     
 races in the 18th Ward initially for his father  
 and later his brother Terry. He held organize    
 the workers on the polls and helped support      
 the work of the political party. He also shared  
 invaluable political strategies and advice to    
 the Aldermen Kennedy's Campaign Manager.         
 In his own career, Ronald worked for ten years   
 as Sheriff in the City of St. Louis. He received 
 several commendations, including one for         
 apprehending a suspect without firing one        
 single bullet. The department labeled Ronald     
 a "hero" ; and                                   
      WHEREAS, after leaving the Sheriff's        
 Department, Ronald worked with his uncle         
 Hallester Kennedy who owned a bail bond          
 company. His uncle also owned rental             
 property. He taught Ronald how to rehab          
 homes installing plumbing, electrical wiring,    
 painting, carpentry and flooring. He created     
 an apprenticeship program and taught youth       
 and young adults how to do many of the           
 trades. Ronald was known as a "jack-of-all-      
 trades" and later became a General Contractor.   
 Because he recognized his natural skills and     
 high intelligence, Uncle Hallester tricked       
 Ronald into taking his GED test by giving        
 him a dare; he passed his GED without            
 studying one day for it. Ronald later attended   
 Forest Park and completed his Associate          
 Degree; and                                      
       WHEREAS, Ronald also supported the

          poverty level income guideline for a   
          family of three); and

    Committee Substitute As Amended               
      An Ordinance repealing Section One,         
part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining        
to the opening of bids, codified as Section       
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of       
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the    
same subject matter which allows a local bidder   
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid       
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new        
provision on the same subject matter;             
containing severability clause.                   
      WHEREAS, local businesses which seek        
to enter into contracts with the City of St.      
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with      
businesses from other areas because of the        
higher administrative costs of doing business     
in the City;                                      
     WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis               
desires to encourage businesses to remain in      
the City and to relocate to the City;             
      WHEREAS, by enacting a local                
preference law that allows a local firm to match  
the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%          
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to      
encourage and stimulate local business.           
     BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF                
ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                             
     SECTION ONE. Section One, part               
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.       
     SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                 
thereof is the following new section.             
     5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                  
      A. Proposals shall be opened at the time    
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the      
presence of such bidders as desire to be          
present, and shall be open to the inspection      
of bidders.                                       
      B. The bids shall not be materially         
modified or amended as to price, specification    
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,   
after opening except when the lowest bid is       
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid      
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder      
within two percent of the lowest bid may          
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches   
 the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner     
 may select the bid from the local bidder. If     
 more than one local bidder is within two         
 percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest  
 local bidder may match the bid. In all other     
 circumstances, modification, supplementation     
 or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.   
 For purposes of this chapter, local bidder       
 means a bidder whose principal place of          
 business is within the City of St. Louis, has    
 had a valid business license for at least one    
 year, and is current in payment of local taxes.  
 Principal place of business shall be defined as  
 the business's physical office, plant, or site   
 where a majority (51%) of the full-time          
 employees, chief officer, and managers of the    
 business regularly work and conduct business,    
 or where the plant or office and equipment       
 required for the furnishing of the goods or      
 performance of the services provided to the      
 City, as required by the contract, are physically
 located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
 taxable year immediately prior to the date of    
 the bid.                                         
       C. Bids may be for one or more or all the  
 articles advertised for, but there shall be a    
 specific bid on each article. The award may be   
 made to the lowest bidder for any article, or    
 to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition  
 or any part thereof, but the Board of            
 Standardization may reject any or all bids or    
 any part of any bid.                             
      SECTION THREE. Severability.                
       The provisions of this section are         
 severable. If any provision of this ordinance    
 is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not   
 affect other provisions of the ordinance which   
 can be given effect without the invalid          
 provision.                                       
 Approved: April 29, 2013                         
      The right to reject any and all bids is
