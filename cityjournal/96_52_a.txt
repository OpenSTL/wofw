to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision on the same subject matter;

desires to encourage businesses to remain in

WHEREAS, by enacting a local
preference law that allows a local firm to match

encourage and stimulate local business.

or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more than one local bidder is within two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest

year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as

employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment

City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be

to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or any part thereof, but the Board of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.

The provisions of this section are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not

can be given effect without the invalid
provision.
