collaboration: Shakespeare Festival St. Louis,    
a legendary theatrical mainstay, and recently     
formed Urban Speak Out, which consists of         
talented, low-income inner city college

Style will use edutainment as a way to explore    
the relationship between power and ethics         
during Julius Caesar's time and modern politics   
in action. Through dramatic reading, poetry,      
music, along with "on-the-spot" interactions      
with individuals who attend the event, Urban      
Speak Out presenters look at timeless themes

honor. The event is free and open to the public;

together from East St. Louis and St. Louis        
first created Urban Speak Out as a virtual        
community in July 2013. Social media              
provided a platform, a forum, and showcase        
for talented urban young people to express        
themselves in a respectful manner that            
motivates and reinforces favorable changes in     
them and their community. "Let creativity be      
your motivation," became their slogan; and        
     WHEREAS, through original poetry,            
songs, music, speeches, dance, photography,

impressions of urban young people; and            
    WHEREAS, via its website, Urban               
Speak Out strives to showcase talented young      
 people from all over the world. Participants

 community that is based on creativity.

 to his vast criminal record, is currently serving  
 15 years; and

       WHEREAS, Jesse Jackson, Sr. became           
 one of the most influential African-Americans      
 of the late 20th century. He rose to               
 prominence working within Martin Luther

         Resolution No. 17                       
             Alvin Ailey                         
       American Dance Theater                    
      WHEREAS, Alvin Ailey American              
 Dance Theater grew from a now-fabled            
 performance in March 1958 at the 92nd Street    
 Y in New York City. Led by Alvin Ailey and      
 a group of young African-American modern        
 dancers, that performance changed forever the   
 perception of American dance; and               
      WHEREAS, the Ailey company has             
 gone on to perform for an estimated 25 million  
 people at theaters in 48 states and 71 countries
 on six continents -- as well as millions more   
 through television broadcasts; and              
       WHEREAS, in 2008, a U.S.                  
 Congressional resolution designated the         
 Company as "a vital American cultural           
 ambassador to the world" that celebrates the    
 uniqueness of the African-American cultural     
 experience and the preservation and             
 enrichment of the American modern dance         
 heritage; and                                   
      WHEREAS, when Mr. Ailey began              
 creating dances, he drew upon his "blood        
 memories" of Texas, the blues, spirituals, and  
 gospel as inspiration, which resulted in the    
 creation of his most popular and critically     
 acclaimed work, Revelations. Although he        
 created 79 ballets over his lifetime, Mr. Ailey 
 maintained that his company was not             
 exclusively a repository for his own work;      
 and                                             
      WHEREAS, today, the Company                
 continues Mr. Ailey's mission by presenting     
 important works of the past and                 
 commissioning new ones. In all, more than       
 235 works by over 90 choreographers have        
 been part of the Ailey company's repertory.     
 Before his untimely death in 1989, Alvin Ailey  
 named Judith Jamison as his successor, and      
 over the next 21 years, she brought the         
 Company to unprecedented success. Ms.           
 Jamison, in turn, personally selected Robert    
 Battle to succeed her in 2011, and The New      
 York Times declared he "has injected the        
 company with new life"; and                     
      WHEREAS, Mr. Battle has a long-            
standing association with the Ailey              
organization. A frequent choreographer and       
artist-in-residence at Ailey since 1999, he has  
set many of his works on Alvin Ailey American    
Dance Theater and Ailey II, and at The Ailey     
School; and                                      
      WHEREAS, the Company's current             
repertory includes his ballets In/Side and       
Strange Humors. In addition to expanding the     
Ailey repertory with works by artists as         
diverse as Kyle Abraham, Aszure Barton,          
Ronald K. Brown, Garth Fagan, Bill T. Jones,     
Jioi Kylian, Wayne McGregor, Ohad Naharin,       
and Paul Taylor.                                 
     NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of             
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

American Dance Theater and we further direct     
the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of      
this Resolution across the minutes of these      
proceedings and to prepare a commemorative       
copy to the end that it may be presented to

is big on community involvement and family;      
and                                              
     WHEREAS, the youngest of five               
children, David and his siblings were raised     
by educators, Pat Eckstein, an elementary        
school teacher, and Whitey Eckstein, a high      
school history teacher. Big on family values,    
the Ecksteins' taught that family comes first.   
Other core values included "always give 100      
percent" and "no complaining"; and               
     WHEREAS, we are pleased that David          
supports community involvement with              
America SCORES St. Louis and the City of         
St. Louis, and encourages all to dream BIG

             ORDINANCE #69431                      
              Board Bill No. 295                   
     Committee Substitute As Amended               
       An Ordinance repealing Section One,         
 part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining        
 to the opening of bids, codified as Section       
 5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of       
 St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the    
 same subject matter which allows a local bidder   
 to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid       
 is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new        
 provision on the same subject matter;             
 containing severability clause.                   
       WHEREAS, local businesses which seek        
 to enter into contracts with the City of St.      
 Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with      
 businesses from other areas because of the        
 higher administrative costs of doing business     
 in the City;                                      
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis               
 desires to encourage businesses to remain in      
 the City and to relocate to the City;             
       WHEREAS, by enacting a local                
 preference law that allows a local firm to match  
 the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%          
 percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to      
 encourage and stimulate local business.           
      BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF                
 ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                             
      SECTION ONE. Section One, part               
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.       
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                 
 thereof is the following new section.             
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                  
       A. Proposals shall be opened at the time    
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the      
 presence of such bidders as desire to be          
 present, and shall be open to the inspection      
 of bidders.                                       
       B. The bids shall not be materially        
 modified or amended as to price, specification   
 or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,  
 after opening except when the lowest bid is      
 from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid     
 is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder     
 within two percent of the lowest bid may         
 match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches  
 the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner     
 may select the bid from the local bidder. If     
 more than one local bidder is within two         
 percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest  
 local bidder may match the bid. In all other     
 circumstances, modification, supplementation     
 or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.   
 For purposes of this chapter, local bidder       
 means a bidder whose principal place of          
 business is within the City of St. Louis, has    
 had a valid business license for at least one    
 year, and is current in payment of local taxes.  
 Principal place of business shall be defined as  
 the business's physical office, plant, or site   
 where a majority (51%) of the full-time          
 employees, chief officer, and managers of the    
 business regularly work and conduct business,    
 or where the plant or office and equipment       
 required for the furnishing of the goods or      
 performance of the services provided to the      
 City, as required by the contract, are physically
 located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
 taxable year immediately prior to the date of    
 the bid.                                         
       C. Bids may be for one or more or all the  
 articles advertised for, but there shall be a    
 specific bid on each article. The award may be   
 made to the lowest bidder for any article, or    
 to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition  
 or any part thereof, but the Board of            
 Standardization may reject any or all bids or    
 any part of any bid.                             
      SECTION THREE. Severability.                
       The provisions of this section are         
 severable. If any provision of this ordinance    
 is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not   
 affect other provisions of the ordinance which   
 can be given effect without the invalid          
 provision.                                       
 Approved: April 29, 2013                         
      The right to reject any and all bids is     
 reserved
