           Resolution No. 200                      
      WHEREAS, This January 2014, The              
City of St. Louis experienced some of the worst    
cold weather and accumulated snowfall in           
several decades; and                               
      WHEREAS, We all appreciate the               
dedicated hard work and long hours that the        
employees of the City of St. Louis extended        
attempting to remove the snow from our city        
streets, especially the Street Department          
employees of whom some worked 12 hour              
shifts; and                                        
     WHEREAS, Although the low                     
temperatures and large amounts of                  
accumulated snowfall is unusual for The City       
of St. Louis, it is not unheard of or              
unprecedented; and                                 
     WHEREAS, Over the years, the City             
of St. Louis has experienced several separate      
periods during the Winter Seasons (December        
21- March 20) when there were large amounts        
of snowfall; and                                   
      WHEREAS, Although the Executive              
Branch of the City of St. Louis, specifically,     
the Mayor's Office appoints the Director of        
Streets whose title is Street Commissioner and     
who reports directly to the Mayor, the Street      
Commissioner should also work with and keep        
informed the Legislative Branch in the City        
of St. Louis which is known as The Board of        
Aldermen; and                                      
      WHEREAS, The Street Commissioner             
should make sure that the City of St. Louis        
has a snow removal plan that when                  
implemented would ensure that snow removal         
in the City would be done in an orderly, timely    
fair manner across the entire City of St. Louis    
so that the residents and those doing business     
with our fair city or just visiting could as soon  
as possible return to their everyday activities    
such as going to work, school, and church and      
      WHEREAS, It is of the utmost                 
importance that this snow removal plan be in       
writing and disseminated to the Legislative        
Branch of the City of St. Louis along with         
other elected Officials and the general public     
at large; and                                      
     WHEREAS, The current written Snow             
Removal Policy of the City of St. Louis is to      
pretreat the City's Snow Routes with a brine       
 solution and once the snow begins to fall, the    
 plow/salt trucks are to make their rounds         
 treating and plowing as necessary. Also, if       
 the forecast calls for several days of below-     
 freezing temperatures and little sunshine,        
 indicating snow will not be melting away          
 quickly, crews are to salt residential            
 intersections to ensure safe stopping.; and       
       WHEREAS, Additionally, the written          
 snow removal policy goes on to state Plowing      
 Residential streets is NOT FEASIBLE               
 (emphasis added) as the streets are too           
 narrow, often tire ruts are already formed by     
 traffic preventing the City's ability to push     
 the snow, and the difficulty plowing presents     
 for residents parked on the street getting        
 plowed in; and                                    
       WHEREAS, Lastly, the written snow           
 removal policy states that the above              
 procedures are in place for all snow/ice events   
 in the City of St. Louis and instructs our        
 Citizens that is it is not necessary to call to   
 get their street treated and the above stated     
 snow removal policy was repeated by many          
 members of this esteemed Board to their           
 constituents in their respective wards when       
 the constituents called regarding snow            
 removal on their streets and in their             
 neighborhoods during this past snow storm;        
 and                                               
       WHEREAS, When the written Snow              
 Removal Plan for the City of St. Louis was        
 changed it was particularly important that not    
 only should the general public be advised but     
 also ALL MEMBERS of the Legislative Body          
 known as the BOARD OF ALDERMEN                    
 should have been advised of said change so        
 that they may have properly informed their        
 many constituents to the changes in the plan      
 in connection with what the Executive Branch      
 and Street Commissioner were telling the          
 regarding the current snow removal policy for     
 the City ; and                                    
      WHEREAS, The residents and business          
 across the City of St. Louis pay taxes and        
 expect that they will all receive the same basic  
 City Service including snow removal in a          
 timely fair fashion in every neighborhood of      
 the City of St. Louis; and                        
       WHEREAS, Throughout the City there          
 were many citizens who expressed                  
 disappointment and dismay at the lack of snow     
 removal in their neighborhoods and                
 communities. Many Citizens stating specific       
 reasons for their disappointment such as, the     
 snow routes in areas where they lived or          
 worked were not properly cleaned; the             
 secondary streets were not treated and plowed     
 or cleaned; there was a lack of access to the     
 bus stops because the bus stops because they    
 were packed with snow; residential              
 intersections were not salted; the lack of      
 timeliness of when the City decided they        
 would plow residential streets, and the         
 apparent lack of a plan to address removing     
 the large amount of snow; and                   
       WHEREAS, It is the best interest of the   
 Citizens of St. Louis that we seek ways that    
 we as a City can improve upon our snow          
 removal and plan by reexamine our written       
 policy, especially as it relates to large       
 accumulations of snowfall and cold weather,     
 by evaluating our recent response to the snow,  
 and by seeking input from the Citizens of our   
 fair City as how we can better serve them in    
 the removal of snow, so that all of our         
 constituents have confidence that their         
 neighborhoods and communities are receiving     
 the same services and being treated fairly.     
       NOW THEREFORE IT BE                       
 RESOLVED THAT THIS HONORABLE                    
 BOARD OF ALDERMEN direct the Streets            
 Committee to convene hearing for the purpose    
 of examining and investigating the events, and  
 circumstances surrounding the recent snow       
 removal program and to further gather           
 information regarding the current Snow          
 Removal Plan for the City of St. Louis, how     
 that plan can be improved, how we can better    
 implement the City's Plan, and how we can       
 better disseminate information and changes      
 to the plan to the members of the Board of      
 Aldermen, elected officials, as well as to ALL  
 residents, businesses, and visitors and the     
 general public at large.

     Committee Substitute As Amended             
       An Ordinance repealing Section One,       
 part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining      
 to the opening of bids, codified as Section     
 5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of     
 St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the  
 same subject matter which allows a local bidder 
 to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid     
 is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new      
 provision on the same subject matter;           
 containing severability clause.                 
       WHEREAS, local businesses which seek      
 to enter into contracts with the City of St.    
 Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with    
 businesses from other areas because of the      
 higher administrative costs of doing business   
 in the City;                                    
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis             
 desires to encourage businesses to remain in    
 the City and to relocate to the City;           
       WHEREAS, by enacting a local              
 preference law that allows a local firm to match
 the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%        
 percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to    
 encourage and stimulate local business.         
      BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF              
 ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                           
      SECTION ONE. Section One, part             
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.     
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu               
 thereof is the following new section.           
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                
      A. Proposals shall be opened at the time   
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the    
 presence of such bidders as desire to be        
present, and shall be open to the inspection     
of bidders.                                      
      B. The bids shall not be materially        
modified or amended as to price, specification   
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,  
after opening except when the lowest bid is      
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid     
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder     
within two percent of the lowest bid may         
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches  
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner     
may select the bid from the local bidder. If     
more than one local bidder is within two         
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest  
local bidder may match the bid. In all other     
circumstances, modification, supplementation     
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.   
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder       
means a bidder whose principal place of          
business is within the City of St. Louis, has    
had a valid business license for at least one    
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.  
Principal place of business shall be defined as  
the business's physical office, plant, or site   
where a majority (51%) of the full-time          
employees, chief officer, and managers of the    
business regularly work and conduct business,    
or where the plant or office and equipment       
required for the furnishing of the goods or      
performance of the services provided to the      
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of    
the bid.                                         
      C. Bids may be for one or more or all the  
articles advertised for, but there shall be a    
specific bid on each article. The award may be   
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or    
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition  
or any part thereof, but the Board of            
Standardization may reject any or all bids or    
any part of any bid.                             
     SECTION THREE. Severability.                
      The provisions of this section are         
severable. If any provision of this ordinance    
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not   
affect other provisions of the ordinance which   
can be given effect without the invalid          
provision.                                       
Approved: April 29, 2013                         
     The right to reject any and all bids is     
reserved
