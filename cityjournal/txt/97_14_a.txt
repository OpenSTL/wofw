Resolution No. 77
George Ignatius Kennedy

WHEREAS, George I. Kennedy was
born in St Louis and has lived his entire life
here. George’s parents, Harry and Ida
Kennedy, met at the 1904 World’s Fair, Harry
from St. Louis and Ida Schuhmann up from
Louisville, KY. They married and had eight
children, George was their seventh. George
grew up on Lindell Blvd. not far from the
New Cathedral. George went to Cathedral
Grade school and was an alter boy. He
apparently holds the record for climbing out
onto the Cathedral dome and making it down
the most tiles, 13! George’s family moved to
Kingsbury Ave. and St. Roch Parish when he
was in 7th grade. George graduated from St.
Roch and went to St. Louis University High
School. He graduated in 1943 from SLUH.
Once graduated, he and his friends all went
and enlisted in the services for WWII. George
went into the Marines and was in the First
Marine Division. He was stationed in the
Pacific and fought at Peleliu and Okinawa.
George was a Corporal and the Radio Operator

in the Artillery and earned two bronze stars;

some modeling in his younger days for
Anheuser Busch products. He worked at
D’Arcy for 33 years and retired at age 62; and

WHEREAS, George’s true claim to fame
was catching and marrying the love of his life,
Helen Jane Murphy. Their first date was April
13, 1947 and they dated for 8 years. Helen
Jane sent him on his way many times due to
his trouble pulling the trigger on marriage.
George was always held back by the thought
that he wanted to be a priest. He finally asked
Helen Jane to marry him and they were married
October 22, 1955. Helen Jane Murphy
worked for the St. Louis Cardinals, was Bing
DeVine’s secretary and the first woman to go
to Spring Training with the team; and

WHEREAS, George and Helen Jane had
two children, George Calahan “Cal” Kennedy
and Joris Murphy “Jorie” Kennedy. George
cared for Helen Jane once she was diagnosed
with Parkinson’s Disease and later Lewey
Body Dementia. George was with Helen Jane
every minute of her illness and loved her
completely. Helen Jane Murphy Kennedy
went to heaven on November 24, 2010. George
is incomplete without Helen Jane by his side;
and

WHEREAS, George’s best friend is his
black lab, Molly. They do everything together
and go everywhere together. George has also
been blessed with a wonderful son-in-law,
Steve O’Malley and two amazing grandson’s
John Mulcahy “Jack” O’Malley and Peter
Murphy “Pete” O’Malley; and

WHEREAS, George is a proud member
of St. Gabriel the Archangel Parish, where he
attends daily Mass. He is a member of the
Ghouls Athletic Club, a group that started in
a room over a garage in the Parkview
Neighborhood with about 15 teenage boys in
1940. The Ghouls grew to more than 25
members and the girlfriends and wives of the
Ghouls started the WAGs, Women’s Auxiliary
Ghouls. These were, and are, George’s best
friends. George was an avid tennis player
and ranked in St. Louis at one time. He had to
stop playing at age 85 when Helen Jane got
too ill and George did not want to leave her
side.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize George Ignatius
Kennedy and we further direct the Clerk of
this Board to spread a copy of this Resolution
across the minutes of these proceedings and

Resolution No. 79
Marvin Davis

WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
Mr. Marvin Davis has been named Father’s
Support Center’s Father of the Year; and

WHEREAS, Marvin Davis is a funny
guy. An aspiring stand-up comic, this easygoing single dad is quick with a joke, but very
reflective when he talks about his time at
Fathers’ Support Center. “I was born in ’81,
and I graduated with Class 81,” says Davis.
“So it was like I was born again.” Davis was
referred to Fathers’ Support Center by a friend
“who saw the hunger and the passion that I
had for my son — and that I wanted to take it
to the next level.”; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Davis credits the
program with teaching him how to be a better
father on many levels — from how to
discipline, to how to develop a friendship with
his child, to how to talk “to” and not “at” his
son. But, most of all, Davis says, “The
program gave me a better look at myself” and
allowed him “to be more caring and more
loving” — not only with his son, but with
other fathers struggling in the community; and

WHEREAS, since 2012, Mr. Davis has
had full custody of his son, 12-year-old,
Markel. The father and son live together in a
two-bedroom townhouse.

WHEREAS, Markel says he likes living
with his dad, whom he calls “really funny.”
The 7th-grade basketball player also enjoys
playing, and regularly beating, his father in
“Tips”; and

WHEREAS, When he’s not working at
his job as a deli clerk at Schnucks or spending
time with Markel, Mr. Davis often returns to
Fathers’ Support Center to speak to the men
currently in the program; and

WHEREAS, as a man always looking to
make his audience laugh, Mr. Davis knows
the power of a positive attitude.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize Mr. Marvin Davis
for being honored as Father’s Support
Center’s Father of the Year and we further
direct the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy

of this Resolution across the minutes of these
proceedings and to prepare a commemorative
copy to the end that it may be presented to
our honoree at a time and place deemed
appropriate by the Sponsor.

to the opening of bids, codified as Section

same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision on the same subject matter;
containing severability clause.

higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS, by enacting a local
preference law that allows a local firm to match

percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to
encourage and stimulate local business.

SECTION ONE. Section One, part

presence of such bidders as desire to be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B. The bids shall not be materially

or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more than one local bidder is within two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest

year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as

employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition

or any part thereof, but the Board of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.
SECTION THREE. Severability.
The provisions of this section are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can be given effect without the invalid
provision.
