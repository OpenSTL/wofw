             ORDINANCE #69431                    
              Board Bill No. 295                 
     Committee Substitute As Amended             
       An Ordinance repealing Section One,       
 part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining      
 to the opening of bids, codified as Section     
 5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of     
 St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the  
 same subject matter which allows a local bidder 
 to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid     
 is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new      
 provision on the same subject matter;           
 containing severability clause.                 
       WHEREAS, local businesses which seek      
 to enter into contracts with the City of St.    
 Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with    
 businesses from other areas because of the      
 higher administrative costs of doing business   
 in the City;                                    
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis             
 desires to encourage businesses to remain in    
 the City and to relocate to the City;           
       WHEREAS, by enacting a local              
 preference law that allows a local firm to match
 the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%        
 percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to    
 encourage and stimulate local business.         
      BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF              
 ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                           
      SECTION ONE. Section One, part             
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.     
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu               
 thereof is the following new section.           
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                
      A. Proposals shall be opened at the time   
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the    
presence of such bidders as desire to be         
present, and shall be open to the inspection     
of bidders.                                      
      B. The bids shall not be materially        
modified or amended as to price, specification   
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,  
after opening except when the lowest bid is      
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid     
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder     
within two percent of the lowest bid may         
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches  
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner     
may select the bid from the local bidder. If     
more than one local bidder is within two         
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest  
local bidder may match the bid. In all other     
circumstances, modification, supplementation     
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.   
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder       
means a bidder whose principal place of          
business is within the City of St. Louis, has    
had a valid business license for at least one    
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.  
Principal place of business shall be defined as  
the business's physical office, plant, or site   
where a majority (51%) of the full-time          
employees, chief officer, and managers of the    
business regularly work and conduct business,    
or where the plant or office and equipment       
required for the furnishing of the goods or      
performance of the services provided to the      
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of    
the bid.                                         
      C. Bids may be for one or more or all the  
articles advertised for, but there shall be a    
specific bid on each article. The award may be   
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or    
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition  
or any part thereof, but the Board of            
Standardization may reject any or all bids or    
any part of any bid.                             
     SECTION THREE. Severability.                
      The provisions of this section are         
severable. If any provision of this ordinance    
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not   
affect other provisions of the ordinance which   
can be given effect without the invalid          
provision.                                       
Approved: April 29, 2013                         
     The right to reject any and all bids is     
reserved
