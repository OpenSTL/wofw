 Louis Farrakhan has served the Black           
 Community and Humanity with distinction        
 and dedication for nearly sixty years; and     
      WHEREAS, the Honorable Minister           
 Louis Farrakhan was born on May 11, 1933       
 in Bronx, New York and was reared in a highly  
 disciplined and spiritual household in         
 Roxbury, Massachusetts; and                    
      WHEREAS, Minister Farrakhan,              
 achieved fame in Boston as a vocalist, calypso 
 singer and violinist, but left show business to
 dedicate his life to work of the Most Honorable
 Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam;       
 and                                            
      WHEREAS, the Honorable Minister           
 Louis Farrakhan served as Minister of Boston,  
 Mass. from 1957-1965 and Minister of           
 Harlem, NY from 1965-1975 as well as being     
 appointed the National Representative of the   
 Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad and the         
 Nation of Islam; and                           
      WHEREAS, after the departure of the       
 Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad in 1975         
 and the re-appraisal of the condition of Black 
 people and the value of the Teachings of the   
 Honorable Elijah Muhammad, Minister            
 Farrakhan decided to return to the teachings   
 and program with a proven ability to uplift    
and reform the Black Community; and              
     WHEREAS, the Honorable Minister             
Louis Farrakhan's tremendous success is          
evidenced by mosques and study groups in         
over 120 cities in America, Europe, the          
Caribbean and missions in West Africa and        
South Africa devoted to the Teachings of the     
Honorable Elijah Muhammad; and                   
      WHEREAS, the historic 1995 Million         
Man March on the Mall in Washington, D.C.,       
which drew nearly two million men. Minister      
Farrakhan was inspired to call the March out     
of his concern over the negative image of Black  
men perpetuated by the media and movie           
industries, which focused on drugs and gang      
violence. In rebuilding the Nation of Islam,     
Minister Farrakhan has renewed respect for       
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, his               
Teachings and Program.

 reserves the right to consider criteria other      
 than the low bid in the award of a contract.       
 Among other factors, the Board will consider

 Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and             
 associated Regulations could apply to the          
 service for which bids are being sought herein.    
 This Ordinance requires that, unless specific      
 exemptions apply, all individuals who perform      
 work pursuant to a contract executed between       
 the successful bidder and the City must be         
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage       
 rates and if rates are adjusted during the term    
 of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,         
 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.    
 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
 Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration          
 with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration   
 with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.  
 A successful bidder's failure to comply with       
 the contract provisions related to the Living      
 Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
 the contract and the imposition of additional      
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
 Regulations.                                       
       Copies of the Ordinance and Regulations

      Bidders are also advised that the State       
 of Missouri requires workers on all public         
 works projects to be paid prevailing wages.        
 The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the       
 contracting public body of $100 per day (or        
 portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than    
 the prevailing rate for any work done under        
 the contract by the contractor or by any           
 subcontractor (Section 290.250, RSMo.).

the City of St. Louis has determined that the     
following living wage rates are now in effect     
for employees of covered contracts:               
     1)   Where health benefits as defined in

          employee, the living wage rate is       
          $12.21 per hour (130% of the federal    
          poverty level income guideline for a    
          family of three); and                   
     2)   Where health benefits as defined in     
          the Ordinance are not provided to       
          the employee, the living wage rate is   
          $15.92 per hour (130% of the federal

of the City of St. Louis.
