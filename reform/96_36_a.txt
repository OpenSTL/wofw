 appearance of impropriety I will abstain from     
 the vote.

 in Fitzhugh, Arkansas, and moved to St. Louis

 husband, Jesse B. Harris Sr. There goal was to   
 provide educational opportunity for their two    
 sons, Foster and Jesse. Both Myrtle and her      
 husband were middle age at the time and          
 uprooting the family was a sacrifice. She        
 instilled educational attainment and good        
 values in her children who have achieved well    
 and gave both parents the satisfaction they      
 wanted. Jesse earned a Ph.D. from St. Louis

 neighborhood might be that she modeled good      
 citizenship and encouraged many to be good       
 citizens for all of her life.

          family of three); and

              Board Bill No. 295                 
     Committee Substitute As Amended             
       An Ordinance repealing Section One,       
 part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining      
 to the opening of bids, codified as Section     
 5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of     
 St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the  
 same subject matter which allows a local bidder 
 to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid     
 is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new      
 provision on the same subject matter;           
 containing severability clause.                 
       WHEREAS, local businesses which seek      
 to enter into contracts with the City of St.    
 Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with    
 businesses from other areas because of the      
 higher administrative costs of doing business   
 in the City;                                    
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis             
 desires to encourage businesses to remain in    
 the City and to relocate to the City;           
       WHEREAS, by enacting a local              
 preference law that allows a local firm to match
 the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%        
 percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to    
 encourage and stimulate local business.         
      BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF              
 ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                           
      SECTION ONE. Section One, part             
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.     
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu               
 thereof is the following new section.           
     5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                     
      A. Proposals shall be opened at the time       
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the         
presence of such bidders as desire to be             
present, and shall be open to the inspection         
of bidders.                                          
      B. The bids shall not be materially            
modified or amended as to price, specification       
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,      
after opening except when the lowest bid is          
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid         
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder         
within two percent of the lowest bid may             
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches      
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner         
may select the bid from the local bidder. If         
more than one local bidder is within two             
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest      
local bidder may match the bid. In all other         
circumstances, modification, supplementation         
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.       
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder           
means a bidder whose principal place of              
business is within the City of St. Louis, has        
had a valid business license for at least one        
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.      
Principal place of business shall be defined as      
the business's physical office, plant, or site       
where a majority (51%) of the full-time              
employees, chief officer, and managers of the        
business regularly work and conduct business,        
or where the plant or office and equipment           
required for the furnishing of the goods or          
performance of the services provided to the          
City, as required by the contract, are physically    
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one    
taxable year immediately prior to the date of        
the bid.                                             
      C. Bids may be for one or more or all the      
articles advertised for, but there shall be a        
specific bid on each article. The award may be       
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or        
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition      
or any part thereof, but the Board of                
Standardization may reject any or all bids or        
any part of any bid.                                 
     SECTION THREE. Severability.                    
      The provisions of this section are             
severable. If any provision of this ordinance        
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not       
affect other provisions of the ordinance which       
can be given effect without the invalid              
provision.                                           
Approved: April 29, 2013                             
     The right to reject any and all bids is         
reserved
