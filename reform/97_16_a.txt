for the 4517-25 S. Kingshighway Blvd.            
Redevelopment Area (as further defined herein,   
the "Plan") after finding that said              
Redevelopment Area ("Area") is blighted as       
defined in Section 99.320 of the Revised         
Statutes of Missouri, as amended (the            
"Statute" being Sections 99.300 to 99.715        
RSMo inclusive, as amended); containing a        
description of the boundaries of the Area in     
the City of St. Louis ("City"), attached hereto  
and incorporated herein as Attachment "A",       
finding that redevelopment and rehabilitation

Attachment "B", pursuant to Section 99.430

 by private enterprise; finding that no property    
 in the Area may be acquired by the Land            
 Clearance for Redevelopment Authority of the       
 City of St. Louis ("LCRA"), a public body          
 corporate and politic created under Missouri

           Resolution No. 86                    
             Lotus Avenue                       
          Block Party Reunion                   
       WHEREAS, On September 21, 2013,          
 the triple block of Lotus Avenue (5000-5200)   
 in the Kingsway West Neighborhood of North     
 St. Louis, celebrated its first "United Block  
 Party" and the original idea and planning for  
 this event came from five men who lived on     
 the blocks; and                                
     WHEREAS, These men not only                  
planned this block party, but they also           
prepared and cooked all the ribs, hamburgers,     
hot dogs, fried chicken, and fish as well as      
recruited other block residents to provide side   
dishes to go along with the prepared meats;       
and                                               
      WHEREAS, In addition to the cooking         
and recruiting of others to provide side dishes,  
they also made contact with out-of town           
family members and friends who grew up on         
the block to request their attendance to this     
great celebration. Much to their surprise, the    
response was phenomenal and the block party       
morphed into a beautiful, heart-warming, tear-    
filled family reunion; and                        
     WHEREAS, The children played on a            
huge bounce house and were served snow cones      
and cotton candy treats which was a big hit       
with everyone. Horses trotted down the block      
for our children's entertainment, and every       
young person received a bag of treats. A D.J.     
was hired for music entertainment. Special        
honors were given to the oldest person living     
on the block, and to the first African American   
family that moved onto the block in 1951 and      
the men pulled off one of the best "United        
Block Parties" in the history of St. Louis; and   
      WHEREAS, The team of men                    
understood the importance of and were             
committed to community unity. That                
commitment continued through the 2013-2014        
fall and winter seasons. While continuing this    
camaraderie of working together for the 5000-     
5200 block of Lotus, tragedy struck on January    
5, 2014 when one of the men, Mr. Orin Clark       
passed away after shoveling snow at his home;     
and                                               
      WHEREAS, In January 2014 there was          
a historic amount of snowfall in the City of      
St. Louis and the snowfall reached a height       
which made it impossible for the City of St.      
Louis to plow the City's side streets yet, it     
was imperative to have the 5000-5200 blocks       
Lotus clear of snow and ice from the streets      
for the grieving family of Mr. Clark who were     
planning their loved one's funeral service; and   
      WHEREAS, The four remaining friends         
discussed a possible solution to the snow         
dilemma and their solution was to clear the       
street of snow and ice themselves. Therefore,     
one cold day in January 2014, Mr. Clark's         
four friends worked tirelessly from early         
morning until late afternoon to clear the street  
and sewer drains, of snow and ice so that by      
evening the entire triple blocks of Lotus was     
clear making way for the grieving family and      
friends of Mr. Clark to park on the street        
during their time of mourning; and                
       WHEREAS, There is constant search           
 for people, especially men who are willing to     
 volunteer and serve in our communities and        
 thereby set an examples for the next generation   
 of what true community means and set              
 examples through their actions of some of the     
 things a real man does to help his community;     
 and                                               
      WHEREAS, The residents of Lotus              
 Avenue are grateful to the men who live on        
 their block who are willing to give of            
 themselves for the peace and safety of the        
 community and look forward to these men           
 continuing to be a beacon of light for our        
 community to follow. As such the four             
 surviving men have begun plans for the 2014       
 Block Party/Family Reunion whose motto is,        
 "The Neighborhoods of North St. Louis are         
 Wonderful Places to Live and Together We          
 Can Make it Better"; and                          
       WHEREAS, There is often negative            
 attention given to those who do the wrong         
 thing but very little attention and appreciation  
 for those who everyday do the right thing or      
 for those who go above and beyond their duty      
 in doing the right thing.                         
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                          
 RESOLVED, That the Members of this                
 Honorable Board of Aldermen join the

 HonorableLewisE.Reed,President,BoardofAldermen  
          Resolution No. 91                      
      Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity                  
       WHEREAS, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity        
 was founded at Howard University in             
 Washington, D.C., January 9, 1914, by three     
 young African-American male students. The       
 Founders, Honorable A. Langston Taylor,         
 Honorable Leonard F. Morse, and Honorable       
 Charles I. Brown, wanted to organize a Greek    
 letter fraternity that would truly exemplify    
 the ideals of brotherhood, scholarship; and     
      WHEREAS, The Founders deeply                
wished to create an organization that viewed      
itself as "a part of" the general community       
rather than "apart from" the general              
community. They believed that each potential      
member should be judged by his own merits,        
rather than his family background or              
affluence...without regard to race, nationality,  
skin tone or texture of hair. They desired for    
their fraternity to exist as part of an even      
greater brotherhood which would be devoted        
to the "inclusive we" rather than the "exclusive  
we"; and                                          
      WHEREAS, from its inception, the            
Founders also conceived Phi Beta Sigma as a       
mechanism to deliver services to the general      
community. Rather than gaining skills to be       
utilized exclusively for themselves and their     
immediate families, they held a deep              
conviction that they should return their newly    
acquired skills to the communities from which     
they had come. This deep conviction was           
mirrored in the Fraternity's motto, "Culture      
for Service and Service for Humanity"; and        
      WHEREAS, Today, Phi Beta Sigma has          
blossomed into an international organization      
of leaders. No longer a single entity, members    
of the Fraternity have been instrumental in       
the establishment of the Phi Beta Sigma           
National Foundation, the Phi Beta Sigma           
Federal Credit Union and The Sigma Beta Club      
Foundation.; and                                  
      WHEREAS, The brothers of Phi Beta           
Sigma are the Fraternity's most valuable          
resource and strength. They are the primary       
means by which the Phi Beta Sigma objectives      
will be achieved. In order to accomplish the      
Fraternity's objectives, it is essential that     
systems are instituted that effectively embody    
"Culture for Service and Service for              
Humanity" and promote brotherhood,                
scholarship; and                                  
       WHEREAS, To optimize Phi Beta              
Sigma's effectiveness, the Fraternity will        
Strengthen and serve proactively the              
brotherhood, as a supportive resource that        
positively impacts the Fraternity's growth and    
financial solvency. Reaffirm and maintain a       
strong commitment to brotherhood,                 
scholarship and service. Ensure that the          
Fraternity programs are focused and               
committed to serving humanity. Create an          
environment that respects the dignity and         
worth of each brother. Exhibit integrity and      
ethical behavior in conducting the Fraternity's   
business, serving as a model for all Greek-       
letter organizations. Maintain and improve the    
Fraternity's technological literacy, in order to  
better service its members and the community      
at large. Encourage a closer and mutually         
 beneficial working relationship with fellow       
 Greek-letter organizations, other community       
 service organizations, businesses and             
 government. Select leaders who are committed      
 and have demonstrated their ability to lead.      
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of              
 the City of St. Louis, that we pause in our       
 deliberations to recognize and honor the          
 members Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity and we          
 thank them for their tireless efforts for over    
 100 years of excellence and on behalf of the      
 citizens of this community we direct the Clerk    
 of this Board to prepare a commemorative

          Resolution No. 92                        
     Bishop T. Larry Kirkland, Sr.                 
      WHEREAS, Bishop T. Larry Kirkland            
 received his early education in the Jefferson     
 County Public Schools of Birmingham,              
 Alabama. His preparation for ministry began       
 under the tutelage of his father Rev. H.E.        
 Kirkland, (an AME minister of over 50 years)      
 and from his mother Gladys, (an educator).        
 He received a B.A. Degree in Sociology from       
 Alcorn State University and a Masters from        
 Mississippi State University. He further          
 developed his ministry through higher             
 education at The Claremont School of              
 Theology and the California Graduate School       
 of Theology. Bishop Kirkland's education,         
 along with his experiences as an educator and     
 football coach, prepared him for the rigors       
 and challenges of being an effective pastor;      
 and                                               
       WHEREAS, prior to being elevated to         
 the Episcopacy, Bishop Kirkland served in         
 the "Favored Fifth" for twenty years as the       
 popular pastor of Brookins Community AME          
 Church in Los Angeles, California and in the      
 Eighth Episcopal District (LA, MS). Upon          
 his arrival in Los Angeles, many ministers        
 dubbed him "A Down Home Preacher" as an           
 insult to his southern roots and style of         
 worship. The then pastor, who possesses an        
 extraordinary love for people and their needs,    
 took that insult as a challenge and armed with    
 an anointing and an awareness of the power        
 of the word of God and the southern lineage       
 of most Angelinos; and                            
       WHEREAS, the Bishop began to                
 distinguish himself as a pastor and grew the      
 mission church of twelve members, into a          
 congregation of more than eight thousand.         
 While at Brookins he established a strong social  
 and political AME presence in the city of Los     
 Angeles and the West Coast where he is now      
 affectionately known as "The Down Home          
 Preacher with the Uptown Message." The          
 Bishop maintains his ties with the city's most  
 influential and plans to develop the District   
 both socially and spiritually; and              
       WHEREAS, Bishop T. Larry Kirkland         
 was elected and consecrated the one hundred     
 and fourteenth Bishop of the African            
 Methodist Episcopal Church in 1996 in           
 Louisville, Kentucky. He received his first     
 assignment to the Seventeenth Episcopal         
 District which encompasses the countries of     
 Zaire, Zambia, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi,       
 Malawi and Zimbabwe. After four years of        
 International service in the 17th District; the 
 General Conference of 2000 assigned Bishop      
 Kirkland to serve as the Ecumenical Officer     
 representing the denomination all over the      
 world. In 2001, he served as the President of   
 the Council of Bishops and in 2002, was         
 assigned to serve his birth state (Alabama),    
 the "Notable Ninth" Episcopal District. This    
 gave him the distinct pleasure of holding two   
 offices simultaneously. He is credited with     
 implementing a District-wide community          
 outreach program that included computer         
 literacy training and health services for the   
 uninsured. Health Services were provided        
 from the newly erected, state-of-the-art        
 medical facility located on the 167 acre campus 
 of Daniel Payne/Nichols-Thomas-Grady            
 School of Religion. In 2008, the General        
 Conference assigned Bishop Kirkland to the      
 "Favored Fifth" Episcopal District which        
 includes fifteen Western interior and coastal   
 states, Alaska and India.; and                  
       WHEREAS, Bishop Kirkland for over         
 40 years has placed himself in the company      
 of presidents, government officials, and        
 celebrity personalities. He has been featured   
 in magazines and was seen by the world via      
 satellite welcoming then Senator Barack         
 Obama to Brown Chapel AME Church's              
 observance of Bloody Sunday. He is the          
 author of several books on church growth and    
 continues to be consulted by both Christian     
 and civic organizations. His preaching style    
 and ability to develop strong relationships     
 across denominational and cultural lines have   
 garnered him respect and standing invitations   
 with some of the nation's greatest ministries.  
 Bishop Kirkland is married to Mrs. Mary L.      
 Simon-Kirkland and is the proud father of       
 three adult children and the grandfather of one.

St. Louis Living Wage Ordinance                   
("Ordinance") and the Regulations associated      
therewith, the City Compliance Official for       
the City of St. Louis has determined that the     
following living wage rates are now in effect     
for employees of covered contracts:               
   1)    Where health benefits as defined in      
         the Ordinance are provided to the        
         employee, the living wage rate is        
         $12.37 per hour (130% of the federal     
         poverty level income guideline for a     
         family of three); and                    
    2)    Where health benefits as defined in      
          the Ordinance are not provided to        
          the employee, the living wage rate is    
          $16.18 per hour (130% of the federal     
          poverty level income guideline for a     
          family of three, plus fringe benefit     
          rates as defined in the Ordinance).

 pursuant to Chapter 6.20 of the Revised Code      
 of the City of St. Louis.

             Board Bill No. 295                   
    Committee Substitute As Amended               
      An Ordinance repealing Section One,         
part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining        
to the opening of bids, codified as Section       
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of       
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the    
same subject matter which allows a local bidder   
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid       
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new        
provision on the same subject matter;             
containing severability clause.                   
      WHEREAS, local businesses which seek        
to enter into contracts with the City of St.      
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with      
businesses from other areas because of the        
higher administrative costs of doing business     
in the City;                                      
     WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis               
desires to encourage businesses to remain in      
the City and to relocate to the City;             
      WHEREAS, by enacting a local                
preference law that allows a local firm to match  
the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%          
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to      
encourage and stimulate local business.           
     BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF                
ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                             
      SECTION ONE. Section One, part                
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.        
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                  
 thereof is the following new section.              
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                   
       A. Proposals shall be opened at the time     
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the       
 presence of such bidders as desire to be           
 present, and shall be open to the inspection       
 of bidders.                                        
       B. The bids shall not be materially          
 modified or amended as to price, specification     
 or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,    
 after opening except when the lowest bid is        
 from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid       
 is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder       
 within two percent of the lowest bid may           
 match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches    
 the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner       
 may select the bid from the local bidder. If       
 more than one local bidder is within two           
 percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest    
 local bidder may match the bid. In all other       
 circumstances, modification, supplementation       
 or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.     
 For purposes of this chapter, local bidder         
 means a bidder whose principal place of            
 business is within the City of St. Louis, has      
 had a valid business license for at least one      
 year, and is current in payment of local taxes.    
 Principal place of business shall be defined as    
 the business's physical office, plant, or site     
 where a majority (51%) of the full-time            
 employees, chief officer, and managers of the      
 business regularly work and conduct business,      
 or where the plant or office and equipment         
 required for the furnishing of the goods or        
 performance of the services provided to the        
 City, as required by the contract, are physically  
 located in the City of St. Louis for at least one  
 taxable year immediately prior to the date of      
 the bid.                                           
       C. Bids may be for one or more or all the    
 articles advertised for, but there shall be a      
 specific bid on each article. The award may be     
 made to the lowest bidder for any article, or      
 to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition    
 or any part thereof, but the Board of              
 Standardization may reject any or all bids or      
 any part of any bid.                               
      SECTION THREE. Severability.                  
       The provisions of this section are           
 severable. If any provision of this ordinance      
 is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not     
 affect other provisions of the ordinance which     
 can be given effect without the invalid            
 provision.                                         
 Approved: April 29, 2013                    
      The right to reject any and all bids is
 reserved
