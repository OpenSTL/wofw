Board Member Young introduced by                  
request:                                          
           Board Bill No. 211                     
       An ordinance approving a blighting study   
and redevelopment plan dated September 24,        
2013 for the 2224 Indiana Ave. Redevelopment      
Area (as further defined herein, the "Plan")      
after finding that said Redevelopment Area        
("Area") is blighted as defined in Section        
99.320 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri,       
as amended (the "Statute" being Sections          
99.300 to 99.715 RSMo inclusive, as               
amended); containing a description of the         
boundaries of the Area in the City of St. Louis   
("City"), attached hereto and incorporated        
herein as Attachment "A", finding that            
redevelopment and rehabilitation of the Area      
is in the interest of the public health, safety,  
morals and general welfare of the people of       
the City; approving the Plan attached hereto      
and incorporated herein as Attachment "B",        
pursuant to Section 99.430 RSMo, as               
amended; finding that there is a feasible         
financial plan for the redevelopment of the       
Area which affords maximum opportunity for        
redevelopment of the Area by private              
enterprise; finding that no property in the Area  
may be acquired by the Land Clearance for         
Redevelopment Authority of the City of St.        
Louis ("LCRA"), a public body corporate and       
politic created under Missouri law, through       
the exercise of eminent domain; finding that      
no property within the Area is occupied, if it    
should become occupied and the Redeveloper        
(as defined herein) shall be responsible for      
providing relocation assistance pursuant to       
the Plan to any eligible occupants displaced      
as a result of implementation of the Plan;        
finding that financial aid may be necessary to    
enable the Area to be redeveloped in              
accordance with the Plan; finding that there      
shall be available up to a five (5) year real     
estate tax abatement; and pledging cooperation    
of this St. Louis Board of Aldermen ("Board")     
and requesting various officials, departments,    
boards and agencies of the City to cooperate      
and to exercise their respective powers in a      
manner consistent with the Plan; and              
containing a severability clause.

2013 for the 4215 Connecticut St.

     Committee Substitute As Amended               
       An Ordinance repealing Section One,         
 part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining        
 to the opening of bids, codified as Section       
 5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of       
 St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the    
 same subject matter which allows a local bidder   
 to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid       
 is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new        
 provision on the same subject matter;             
 containing severability clause.                   
       WHEREAS, local businesses which seek        
 to enter into contracts with the City of St.      
 Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with      
 businesses from other areas because of the        
 higher administrative costs of doing business     
 in the City;                                      
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis               
 desires to encourage businesses to remain in      
 the City and to relocate to the City;             
       WHEREAS, by enacting a local                
 preference law that allows a local firm to match  
 the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%          
 percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to      
 encourage and stimulate local business.           
      BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF               
 ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                            
      SECTION ONE. Section One, part              
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.      
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                
 thereof is the following new section.            
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                 
       A. Proposals shall be opened at the time   
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the     
 presence of such bidders as desire to be         
 present, and shall be open to the inspection     
 of bidders.                                      
       B. The bids shall not be materially        
 modified or amended as to price, specification   
 or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,  
 after opening except when the lowest bid is      
 from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid     
 is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder     
 within two percent of the lowest bid may         
 match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches  
 the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner     
 may select the bid from the local bidder. If     
 more than one local bidder is within two         
 percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest  
 local bidder may match the bid. In all other     
 circumstances, modification, supplementation     
 or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.   
 For purposes of this chapter, local bidder       
 means a bidder whose principal place of          
 business is within the City of St. Louis, has    
 had a valid business license for at least one    
 year, and is current in payment of local taxes.  
 Principal place of business shall be defined as  
 the business's physical office, plant, or site   
 where a majority (51%) of the full-time          
 employees, chief officer, and managers of the    
 business regularly work and conduct business,    
 or where the plant or office and equipment       
 required for the furnishing of the goods or      
 performance of the services provided to the      
 City, as required by the contract, are physically
 located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
 taxable year immediately prior to the date of    
 the bid.                                         
       C. Bids may be for one or more or all the  
 articles advertised for, but there shall be a    
 specific bid on each article. The award may be   
 made to the lowest bidder for any article, or    
 to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition  
 or any part thereof, but the Board of            
 Standardization may reject any or all bids or    
 any part of any bid.                             
      SECTION THREE. Severability.                
       The provisions of this section are         
 severable. If any provision of this ordinance    
 is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not   
 affect other provisions of the ordinance which   
can be given effect without the invalid  
provision.                               
Approved: April 29, 2013                 
     The right to reject any and all bids
