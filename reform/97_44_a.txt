           Wade Funeral Home                        
          100 Year Anniversary                      
      WHEREAS, the Wade Funeral Home                
 was founded in 1914 by Walter Wade, at a           
 time when there was only three existing funeral    
 homes that would serve African American            
 Families; and                                      
       WHEREAS, the ambitious Wade wanted           
 to give superior care and service to all families  
 which was a ground breaking concept in 1914;       
 and                                                
        WHEREAS, with the help of his               
 dedicated wife Mary, Walter Wade made Wade         
 Funeral Home the kind of funeral home he           
 dreamed of and they were known for their           
 tireless work ethics and overwhelming warmth;      
 and                                                
      WHEREAS, Walter Wade's untimely             
 passing was a tremendous loss to the             
 community however, the funeral home and          
 Wade's tradition lived on as Mary                
 courageously ran the home alone; and             
      WHEREAS, the Wade's never had               
 children and in the early 1940s Walter Wade's    
 nephew Gilbert Wade Grandberry, returned         
 from the Navy and approached his aunt with       
 a request to purchase the funeral home which     
 she granted the request; and                     
       WHEREAS, the first location of the         
 Wade Funeral Home was on Finney in the           
 City of St. Louis and Mr. G as the nephew        
 was known opened a second location for           
 Wade Funeral Home in Kinloch, MO and then        
 later acquired a third location at 4828 Natural  
 Bridge in the City of St. Louis in the 20th      
 Ward in the mid 1970's and for a short time all  
 three locations were open for business; and      
       WHEREAS, Mr. Grandberry later              
 decided to keep the business in a single location
 at 4828 Natural Bridge and expand it as the      
 business grew, acquiring the Wade Florist        
 building next door to the West of the funeral    
 home in the 1970s. Then in 1992 Mr.              
 Grandberry seized another opportunity by         
 purchasing and remodeling the 22,500 square      
 foot building to the east of Wade Funeral Home   
 known today as the Twin Chapel which he          
 named in honor of his twin sister Garnette;      
 and                                              
       WHEREAS, Mr. Grandberry was                
 successful in training many of today's           
 successful funeral home owners who got their     
 start at Wade; and                               
      WHEREAS, in 1999 Mr. Grandberry             
 sold his business to the Perpetual Inc. and      
 Mr. Grandberry was named President               
 Emeritus and helped through the transition;      
 and                                              
        WHEREAS, on August 8, 2002 Mr.            
 Grandberry transitioned to glory. However,       
 if he were alive today it is believed that he    
 would be proud of the dedicated staff at Wade    
 where many of the staff who worked for him       
 still cary out his mission of offering superior  
 service to families at their time of need; and   
      WHEREAS, on June 17, 2014 Wade              
 Funeral Home and Florist was acquired by         
 the ownership team of Saint Louisan Randy        
 Sanderson and Melvin Bryant just in time to      
 celebrate the 100 Anniversary of Wade Funeral    
 Home; and                                        
      WHEREAS, Randy Sanderson and                
 Melvin Bryant are committed to continuing        
 the great legacy started by Mr. Grandberry       
for the next 100 years.                          
     NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
RESOLVED THAT, this Honorable Board              
of Aldermen pause in its deliberations to take   
time to congratulate Wade Funeral Home on        
the occasion of it's 100 year Anniversary.       
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT                 
THIS RESOLUTION be presented to the              
current owners of the Wade Funeral Home at       
a time deemed proper by the sponsors of this     
resolution.                                      
Introduced on the 12th day of December, 2014

          Resolution No. 187                     
             Gregory Niven                       
     WHEREAS, we have been advised that          
on December 28, 2014 at St. Joan of Arc          
Catholic Church, the rank of Eagle Scout will    
be awarded to Gregory Niven; and                 
     WHEREAS, Greg is the son of Anne            
and Doug Niven, who are both proud and           
pleased to                                       
      WHEREAS, this momentous                    
accomplishment in his life; and                  
     WHEREAS, Greg is a member of Boy            
Scout Troop 62, and has been in scouting for     
eleven years. He has been an Order of the        
Arrow member for three years and has earned      
twenty-two merit badges. Greg was the troop      
Chaplain for one year, Assistant Patrol Leader   
for one year and Patrol leader for one year;     
and                                              
      WHEREAS, Greg's Eagle Scout project        
consisted of working with the St. Louis Parks    
Department to install three park benches on      
the Marquette side of Tilles Park in South St.   
Louis near St. Joan of Arc. Using a survey       
wheel, he also measured out and then painted     
the incremental mile markers on the walking/     
running trail that encircles the park. The       
benches will provide needed seating in the       
park, especially for those attending soccer      
games at the adjacent soccer field or watching   
their children play on the playground next to    
the field. Marking the trail will allow walkers  
and runners to better track their distance; and  
      WHEREAS, those who are familiar with       
Scouting are aware that the rank of Eagle Scout  
is a goal sought by many but attained by few;    
requiring intelligence, perseverance, and a      
strong sense of service to your community.       
     NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of             
the City of St. Louis, being apprised of the     
 significant recognition to be bestowed on         
 Gregory Niven at the Eagle Court of Honor,        
 and wishing in some small way to add our          
 congratulations and best wishes to Gregory        
 and his family, we pause in our deliberations     
 to consider and adopt this resolution, and        
 instruct the Clerk of this Board to spread a      
 copy of this resolution over the permanent

to the opening of bids, codified as Section       
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of

      WHEREAS, local businesses which seek        
to enter into contracts with the City of St.      
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with      
businesses from other areas because of the

preference law that allows a local firm to match  
the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%          
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to      
encourage and stimulate local business.

      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                   reserved                        
 thereof is the following new section.                          Carol L. Shepard, CPA
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                               Supply Commissioner  
                                                                (314) 622-4580       
       A. Proposals shall be opened at the time                 www.stlouis-mo.gov   
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the                                        
 presence of such bidders as desire to be                                            
 present, and shall be open to the inspection                                        
 of bidders.                                                                         
       B. The bids shall not be materially                                           
 modified or amended as to price, specification                                      
 or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,                                     
 after opening except when the lowest bid is                                         
 from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid                                        
 is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder                                        
 within two percent of the lowest bid may                                            
 match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches                                     
 the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner                                        
 may select the bid from the local bidder. If                                        
 more than one local bidder is within two                                            
 percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest                                     
 local bidder may match the bid. In all other                                        
 circumstances, modification, supplementation                                        
 or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.                                      
 For purposes of this chapter, local bidder

       C. Bids may be for one or more or all the

 specific bid on each article. The award may be

 to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition

      SECTION THREE. Severability.                                                   
       The provisions of this section are
