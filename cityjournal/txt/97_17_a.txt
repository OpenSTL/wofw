WHEREAS, the primary source of

SECTION 1. The City of St. Louis
urges the State of Missouri to adopt legislation
requiring disclosure of the volumes, types of
petroleum, petroleum products, and petroleum
derivatives; transportation routes; and the
frequency and duration of transfers of
petroleum, so that the state and local
communities can be fully informed of and plan
for the risks posed by the transport of
petroleum by rail.

SECTION 2. The City of St. Louis
strongly urges the U.S. Department of

Transportation (DOT) to increase federal;
tank car design and operation regulations for
petroleum product shipments and aggressively
phase out older-model tank cars used to move
flammable liquids that are not retrofitted to
meet new federal requirements.
SECTION 3. The City of St. Louis
strongly urges the Missouri Department of
Ecology and the Military Department
Emergency Management Division, in
collaboration with the Missouri Department
of Fish and Wildlife and local government
emergency response entities, to assess the
impact to public safety, the environment, the
economy, and traffic of petroleum transport
by the rail through St. Louis and the State of
Missouri.
SECTION 4. The City of St. Louis
requests that the Governor of Missouri, the
Missouri Department of Ecology, the
Missouri State Energy Facility Site Evaluation
Council, and any other relevant agencies
refrain from permitting projects that would
expand the capacity for petroleum export out
of the state otherwise increase the number of
trains carrying petroleum through St. Louis
and other Missouri communities until the
cumulative environmental and safety impacts
of these projects are studied and addressed.
SECTION 5. The City of St. Louis
requests that any railroad company that
operates rail lines adjacent to St. Louis’s
residential neighborhoods assure residents’
safety or reroute those trains into nonresidential areas.

to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the
same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision on the same subject matter;
containing severability clause.

businesses from other areas because of the
higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;
WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS, by enacting a local
preference law that allows a local firm to match
the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to
encourage and stimulate local business.

ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION ONE. Section One, part
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.

5.58.040 - Opening of bids.
A. Proposals shall be opened at the time
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the
presence of such bidders as desire to be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B. The bids shall not be materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more than one local bidder is within two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation

For purposes of this chapter, local bidder

had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where a majority (51%) of the full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.
C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or any part thereof, but the Board of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.
SECTION THREE. Severability.
The provisions of this section are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can be given effect without the invalid
provision.
