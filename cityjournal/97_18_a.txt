tears, wiped noses and bottoms, and created
life-long friendships with dozens of parents
and children; Edna made a difference; and

WHEREAS, now it is time for Edna to
relax and enjoy her memories of baking pies
for the annual harvest party, impromptu

years.

Resolution No. 101
Rosetta Spratt
WHEREAS, Mrs. Rosetta Spratt was
born on January 16, 1911, in Tillatoba,
Mississippi, to Riley and Rosie Betts. She
was the third of four children. Rosetta’s
parents; her grandson, Martin Karl; and her
siblings, Joe Eddie Williams, Minnie
Venerable and Flora Powell, all preceded her
in death; and

WHEREAS, at age eleven the family
moved to Conrad, Missouri, then they moved
to Portageville, Missouri, and finally to St.
Louis, Missouri. There were numerous times
Rosetta had family members to take her to
Portageville, Missouri to visit; and

WHEREAS, Rosetta was educated in
the Mississippi Public School System. She
confessed her hope in Christ under the
leadership of the late Rev. Roy Harris at
Newstead Avenue Missionary Baptist
Church. She faithfully attended church, bible
study, ladies chorus and the Women’s
Missionary Union under the leadership of
Elder Richard until she was unable to attend;
and

WHEREAS, Rosetta was united in holy
matrimony to Otto Spratt on April 14, 1930
and to this union 12 children were born. Four
preceded her in death; Flora, Vernon, Gleno
and Sandra Jean; and

WHEREAS, Rosetta leaves to cherish
her memories: eight children, Eleanor, Otto
Jr., Shirline, Carleton, Barbara Jean, Eunice
LaVern, Marie (Miller) and Vanessa Gail;
twelve grandchildren, Marion Roddy, Lonnie
Roddy, Ronnie Roddy, Rita Rene, Pierre
Aristotle, Carletta, Carl Jr., Tanya, Rosetta,
Michael, Armon G. and Aisha; twenty-three
great grandchildren; nieces and nephews and
great nieces and nephews; and a host of
cousins and friends.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause to
remember the many contributions of Rosetta
Spratt to the citizens of the City of St. Louis
and we join with her many friends in
expressing our sorrow at her passing, and we
further direct the Clerk of this Board to spread
a copy of this Resolution across the minutes
of these proceedings and to prepare a memorial
copy for presentation to the Spratt family, at
a time and place deemed appropriate by the

Resolution No. 99
Resolution Urging Voters to
Oppose Amendment 7 Sales Tax
Increase on August 5, 2014 Ballot
WHEREAS, voters will be deciding on
Missouri constitutional Amendment 7 at the
election to be held on August 5, 2014; and
WHEREAS, Amendment 7 increases
both state sales and use taxes by ¾% for ten
years to create a fund controlled by the
Missouri Highway and Transportation
Commission to be used for transportation
improvements; and
WHEREAS, the $6 billion or more that
will be collected from the proposed sales and
use tax increase is the largest tax increase in
the history of the state of Missouri; and
WHEREAS, this increase would result
in the general sales tax rate in the City of St.
Louis climbing to 9.429%, with the rate in
special districts as high as 11.429%; and
WHEREAS, the tax increase is
excessive, considering that the vast majority
of the funds from this tax will be used to build
highways and bridges, growing a state highway
system that is already one of the most
expansive in the nation; and
WHEREAS, the St. Louis and Kansas
City metropolitan regions already have the
most freeway pavement per capita of any large

metropolitan area in the nation and also have
the lowest rate of highway congestion; and,

WHEREAS, the burden of this tax
increase will fall most heavily on families,
seniors, those with modest incomes, and small
businesses, rather than on the users of the
highway system; and

WHEREAS, the trucking industry,
which does the most damage to roads and
bridges, is exempt from state and local sales
and use taxes; and

WHEREAS, because Amendment 7
prohibits increases in motor fuel taxes and the
imposition of tolls, those who benefit the most
from this huge tax increase will pay virtually
none of it, both now and likely forever; and

WHEREAS, the Missouri General
Assembly in the last session approved
legislation that will reduce income taxes for
the highest earners; and

WHEREAS, the state of Missouri is
cutting budgets for essential services like
education, safety, social services and
healthcare; and

WHEREAS, claims that Amendment 7
will produce thousands of permanent jobs and
improve
safety
are
completely
unsubstantiated and greatly exaggerated; and

WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis has
proposed a number of potentially beneficial
projects that could be paid for with the
proceeds of the sales tax increase; and

WHEREAS, the Missouri Highways
and Transportation Commission will be solely
responsible for deciding how the sales tax
proceeds will be spent; and

WHEREAS, the portion of the
proposed sales tax increase paid by citizens
and businesses in the City of St. Louis will be
greater than the portion of the expenditures
to be made in the City; and

WHEREAS, the continued expansion of
the highway system in suburban areas of the
state will encourage unsustainable
development patterns that are harmful to the
St. Louis region and the City of St. Louis; and

WHEREAS, the sales tax increase will
diminish the future fiscal capacity of the City
by limiting the use of this revenue source to
meet future needs for essential services,
support for Metro, and the expansion of
MetroLink; and

WHEREAS, Amendment 7 is opposed
by the Missouri Municipal League, the St.
Louis County Municipal League, the League
of Women Voters, the Sierra Club, Missouri

Coalition for the Environment, and many other
groups whose interests are generally aligned
with the City of St. Louis; and

WHEREAS, any benefits to the City of
St. Louis of the sales tax increase are uncertain
and largely outweighed by the cost to its
citizens and businesses.

NOW THEREFORE, BE IT
RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF
ALDERMEN OF THE CITY OF ST.
LOUIS, THAT the sales and use tax increases
that would be imposed by passage of
Amendment 7 are excessive, unfair, harmful,
and the wrong priority for the State of
Missouri and the City of St. Louis.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the
Board of Aldermen of the City of St. Louis
urges voters to vote NO on Amendment 7 at
the election to be held on August 5, 2014

after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more than one local bidder is within two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder
means a bidder whose principal place of
business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where a majority (51%) of the full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or any part thereof, but the Board of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.
SECTION THREE. Severability.

The provisions of this section are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can be given effect without the invalid
provision.
Approved: April 29, 2013

The right to reject any and all bids is
reserved
