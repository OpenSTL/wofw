     Committee Substitute As Amended            
       An Ordinance repealing Section One,      
 part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining     
 to the opening of bids, codified as Section    
 5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of    
 St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the 
 same subject matter which allows a local bidder
 to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid    
 is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new     
provision on the same subject matter;              
containing severability clause.                    
      WHEREAS, local businesses which seek         
to enter into contracts with the City of St.       
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with       
businesses from other areas because of the         
higher administrative costs of doing business      
in the City;                                       
     WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis                
desires to encourage businesses to remain in       
the City and to relocate to the City;              
      WHEREAS, by enacting a local                 
preference law that allows a local firm to match   
the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%           
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to       
encourage and stimulate local business.            
     BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF                 
ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                              
     SECTION ONE. Section One, part                
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.        
     SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                  
thereof is the following new section.              
     5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                   
      A. Proposals shall be opened at the time     
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the       
presence of such bidders as desire to be           
present, and shall be open to the inspection       
of bidders.                                        
      B. The bids shall not be materially          
modified or amended as to price, specification     
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,    
after opening except when the lowest bid is        
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid       
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder       
within two percent of the lowest bid may           
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches    
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner       
may select the bid from the local bidder. If       
more than one local bidder is within two           
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest    
local bidder may match the bid. In all other       
circumstances, modification, supplementation       
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.     
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder         
means a bidder whose principal place of            
business is within the City of St. Louis, has      
had a valid business license for at least one      
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.    
Principal place of business shall be defined as    
the business's physical office, plant, or site     
where a majority (51%) of the full-time            
employees, chief officer, and managers of the      
business regularly work and conduct business,      
or where the plant or office and equipment         
required for the furnishing of the goods or        
performance of the services provided to the        
City, as required by the contract, are physically  
 located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
 taxable year immediately prior to the date of    
 the bid.                                         
       C. Bids may be for one or more or all the  
 articles advertised for, but there shall be a    
 specific bid on each article. The award may be   
 made to the lowest bidder for any article, or    
 to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition  
 or any part thereof, but the Board of            
 Standardization may reject any or all bids or    
 any part of any bid.

 provision.
