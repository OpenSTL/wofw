was born on January 11, 1950 in St. Louis to       
Hughes and Geneva Carter. To this union            
there were 9 children born; and                    
       WHEREAS, Wanda was educated in the          
St. Louis Public School System and graduated       
from Charles Sumner High School. Wanda             
loved to learn and was dedicated to pushing        
the importance of education. She was the           
first in the family to receive a Master's Degree.  
She attended Lindenwood University; and            
      WHEREAS, Wanda was a woman of                
many talents and very versatile and whatever       
she put her hands to prospered, she shared         
and utilized her gifts with everyone. She was      
a pillar in the community, demanded respect        
and taught life lessons as they were presented.    
Wanda was employed as an accountant for            
the federal government. Her federal work           
career had been devoted to serving the             
Department of Defense. She also worked in          
the Department of Finance and Accounting,          
and retired after 22 years due to health           
complications; and                                 
      WHEREAS, after several bouts of              
illness, she was called home to glory April 25,    
2013 at 8:15 am. She fought a good fight and       
kept the faith, now she's gone on to the next      
phase in this spiritual journey. She already       
accomplished all of her earthly deeds and was      
ready to breathe with ease; and                    
      WHEREAS, Wanda confessed her faith           
in Christ and was baptized early in her            
childhood at Antioch Baptist Church.               
Growing in her spiritual walk, she yoked up        
with "Big Thunda" and became an active             
member of the Mt. Pleasant Missionary              
Baptist Church. She got busy working on the        
Pastor's Aid and other auxiliaries until she was   
called home; and

many for the humanitarian qualities she            
possessed and shared with everyone. She was        
truly the epitome of the old adage "Let the        
Good that I Do Speak for Me!" She loved life       
and lived it to the fullest. Always reminding      
herself and others "Without Faith, it is           
impossible to please God" and she aimed to         
please God! Wanda was a treasure to know.          
If you met her, you were far from being a          
stranger and if you saw her you were greeted       
with a smile and the TRUTH, where you              
wanted it or not. The world lost a legacy of       
love with Wanda's Exodus. However her home         
going is truly a Heaven gain; and                  
     WHEREAS, Wanda was preceded in                
 death by both her parents, Hughes and Geneva      
 Carter, by her three brothers: her twin-Wildord   
 Carter, John Willis and Eugene Wiley; and

 Carter, Leroy Carter all of St. Louis, and a      
 host of other family, nieces, nephews, God-       
 children, and many of friends.                    
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

 `The Presiding Bishop's Medal' for his work   
 in COGIC Urban Initiatives; and               
      WHEREAS, the greatest asset to his       
 professional and personal life is his beloved 
 wife of 41 years, Missionary Jessie Miller    
Bass. As young children, they had the            
prophetic experience of being saved in the       
same revival service. They are the blessed       
parents of Sean, Craig, and Courtney and         
proud grandparents of Kyng Cleveland, Paige      
Bass and Hannah Bass. Ten years ago they         
lost their eldest son, Sean Edwin, through a     
random and heinous act of violence. From the     
pain and scars of this family tragedy, Pastor

and wounds of others, and have thereby

President of COGIC Urban Initiatives because     
he is dedicated to building the Kingdom of       
God through the Church that he has cherished     
and participated in for a lifetime. In his       
words, "This is an opportunity to bring a        
lifetime of learning and experience to bear on   
behalf of the Church I love and under the        
direction of an awesome, visionary leader,       
Bishop Charles Edward Blake, Sr."; and           
     WHEREAS, those who know Bishop              
Bass well can attest to his intellectual and     
leadership competencies, but they are more       
profoundly impressed by his deep sense of        
loyalty, integrity, humility and fervor for the  
things of God.

 District where her parents continue to reside  
 and where she has maintained the respect and   
 connection with the local residents and        
 business owners/leaders; and                   
      WHEREAS, Sgt. Orange does an              
 exemplary job of insuring that her direct      
 reports receive the direction and guidance     
 when needed, which has resulted several of     
 them being selected for Specialized Units. She 
 welcomes the challenge of assisting Officers   
 overcome their individual struggles and become 
 valued members of the department; and          
       WHEREAS, although her talents are        
 many, utmost in her repertoire is her ability  
 to gain the support of the community as        
 illustrated at a recent homicide scene wherein 
 she was able to quell the potential of a civil 
 disturbance in the College Hill Neighborhood.  
 Due to her strong ties to the community during 
 the "Hot Spot Initiative" occurring in College 
 Hill, crucial information was obtained and     
 acted upon related to the homicide             
 investigations. These are a few reasons why    
 she is deserving of the 5th District Leadership
 Award for 2012.                                
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                      
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of           
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

 Orange for making the City of St. Louis a      
 better place to live and work and we further   
 direct the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy
 of this Resolution across the minutes of these 
 proceedings and to prepare a commemorative     
 copy to the end that it may be presented to    
 our honoree at a time and place deemed         
 appropriate by the Sponsor.

            Resolution No. 96                   
           Sergeant Kyle West                   
       WHEREAS, Sergeant West's                 
 demonstrates his commitment to excellence      
 in his openness and objectivity in making      
 judgments. He avoids making hasty decisions    
 and considers alternatives before making       
 commitments. Sergeant West is known for his    
 professionalism and for fostering a "team      
 spirit" amongst subordinates; and              
      WHEREAS, in addition to his duties as     
 the Administrative Aide, Sergeant West has     
 taken on the responsibility of preparing the   
 Workplace Violence Program. The program        
 was created and presented by Sergeant West     
 to the Safety Council of Greater St. Louis'    
 9th Annual Safety and Health Conference after  
a need for training on violence in the workplace  
was requested following the events at ABB.        
Sergeant West delivered the information to a      
room with approximately 50 conference             
attendees. The presentation was based on          
open source information surrounding key           
topic areas including Active Shooter              
situations. The initial feedback was highly       
encouraging; and                                  
     WHEREAS, the research by Sergeant            
West prepared him for delivering threat           
assessment surveys to the Fifth District's        
public, charter, and parochial schools            
following the tragedy in Newton, Connecticut;     
and                                               
      WHEREAS, Sergeant West tailored the         
presentation for property manager, Craig          
Peters of Colliers International, located at 600  
Washington where he and Fourth District           
Community Outreach Officer Jody Rask              
delivered the training to approximately 30        
participants; and                                 
      WHEREAS, lastly, Sergeant West does         
not hesitate to lead officers in the performance  
of their duties. On two separate occasions        
this past year, Sergeant West responded to        
calls for bank robberies. On both occasions,      
his leadership skills were instrumental in the    
effort to arrest those parties responsible for    
the robberies.                                    
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

           Resolution No. 112                   
             Lee James Sr.                      
       WHEREAS, we have been apprised that      
 on Thursday, August 29, 2013, Lee James Sr.    
 will be recognized by the residents of the     
 Twenty-Second Ward with the presentation       
 of the Good Neighbor Award for a Business;     
 and                                            
       WHEREAS, Lee James Sr. started           
 working for a hauling company about 12 years   
 ago. He noticed that there was a high demand   
 for this service. With Lee's knowledge of the  
 community he realized he could offer the       
 public lower prices and still have a lucrative 
 business. Around 11 years ago, he started his  
 own business in hauling and 6 years later he   
 added a furniture component to his business;   
 and                                            
       WHEREAS, today, Mr. James is the sole    
 proprietor of Lee's Hauling and Furniture      
 located at 6104 Page Boulevard, St. Louis.     
 He has the ambition and resolve to keep one    
 foot in front of the other; and                
      WHEREAS, Mr. James is a God fearing       
 man, a husband, a father, and a family man.    
 One of his greatest passions is to support     
 educational opportunities for children. With   
 his past observations on life, Lee believes if 
 you give back to people with disparities the   
 blessings God gives to us, we should turn      
 around and bless those less fortunate; and     
      WHEREAS, Lee is always willing to give    
 men a chance of employment, where, it may      
 otherwise, be nearly impossible for those same 
men to have employment opportunities and          
provide for themselves and family; and            
       WHEREAS, Lee's work speaks for             
itself. There are few advertising media outlets   
or gimmicks used because his business spreads     
by the referrals of his customers. He has         
established reoccurring business with many        
faithful customers; and                           
     WHEREAS, Mr. James is determined             
to make every day count for the community.        
He hosts a Back to School Event every year.       
His business provides young boys free             
haircuts, all children are rewarded with a        
backpack filled with school supplies, plenty      
of fun activities for the family, and free food;  
and                                               
     WHEREAS, Lee's objective is to create        
a profit, generate revenue for the City of St.    
Louis, and provide as many employment             
opportunities for residents within the            
community; and                                    
      WHEREAS, Lee is not single minded or        
selfish; he's interested in networking with       
surrounding small businesses, community           
clinics, and all other community awareness        
programs. Mr. James believes educating our        
children is very vital in today's world and he    
wants to ensure that he does his part in          
uplifting.                                        
     NOW THEREFORE BE IT

             ORDINANCE #69431                      
              Board Bill No. 295                   
     Committee Substitute As Amended               
       An Ordinance repealing Section One,         
 part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining        
 to the opening of bids, codified as Section       
 5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of       
 St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the    
 same subject matter which allows a local bidder   
 to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid       
 is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new        
 provision on the same subject matter;             
 containing severability clause.                   
       WHEREAS, local businesses which seek        
 to enter into contracts with the City of St.      
 Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with      
 businesses from other areas because of the        
 higher administrative costs of doing business     
 in the City;                                      
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis               
 desires to encourage businesses to remain in      
 the City and to relocate to the City;             
       WHEREAS, by enacting a local                
 preference law that allows a local firm to match  
 the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%          
 percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to      
 encourage and stimulate local business.           
      BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF                
 ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                             
      SECTION ONE. Section One, part               
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.       
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                 
 thereof is the following new section.             
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                  
       A. Proposals shall be opened at the time    
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the      
 presence of such bidders as desire to be          
 present, and shall be open to the inspection      
 of bidders.                                       
       B. The bids shall not be materially         
 modified or amended as to price, specification    
 or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,   
 after opening except when the lowest bid is       
 from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid      
 is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder      
 within two percent of the lowest bid may          
 match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches   
 the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner      
 may select the bid from the local bidder. If     
 more than one local bidder is within two         
 percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest  
 local bidder may match the bid. In all other     
 circumstances, modification, supplementation     
 or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.   
 For purposes of this chapter, local bidder       
 means a bidder whose principal place of          
 business is within the City of St. Louis, has    
 had a valid business license for at least one    
 year, and is current in payment of local taxes.  
 Principal place of business shall be defined as  
 the business's physical office, plant, or site   
 where a majority (51%) of the full-time          
 employees, chief officer, and managers of the    
 business regularly work and conduct business,    
 or where the plant or office and equipment       
 required for the furnishing of the goods or      
 performance of the services provided to the      
 City, as required by the contract, are physically
 located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
 taxable year immediately prior to the date of    
 the bid.                                         
       C. Bids may be for one or more or all the  
 articles advertised for, but there shall be a    
 specific bid on each article. The award may be   
 made to the lowest bidder for any article, or    
 to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition  
 or any part thereof, but the Board of            
 Standardization may reject any or all bids or    
 any part of any bid.                             
      SECTION THREE. Severability.                
       The provisions of this section are         
 severable. If any provision of this ordinance    
 is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not   
 affect other provisions of the ordinance which   
 can be given effect without the invalid          
 provision.                                       
 Approved: April 29, 2013                         
      The right to reject any and all bids is     
 reserved
