COURTESY RESOLUTIONS
CONSENT CALENDAR
President Reed introduced Resolution
No. 162 through 167 and No. 169 and the
Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 162
Girl Scouts of
Eastern Missouri-District 3
WHEREAS, in 1912 Juliette Gordon
Low formed the first troop of 18 girls, in
Savannah, Georgia. The Girl Scout Council
of Greater St. Louis (GSCGSL) Troop #1 was
organized in 1918 In 1922 St. Louis received
its first charter from the Girl Scouts of United
States of America. In 1928 Girl scouting came
to the City of St. Louis District 3. The first
African American troop was formed by Miss
Cleotla Spotts, a teacher at Charles Sumner
High School. A troop also established at Lane
Tabernacle C.M.E. Church. In 1930 Marie
Webb, leader at Central Baptist Church
developed the first “buddy troop”, uniting
Temple Israel troop with the Central Baptist
Troop in a cultural exchange; and

WHEREAS, District 3 Girl Scouts
contributed to the war effort by assisting local
citizens Defense Corps; conducting salvage
drives; purchasing and selling war bonds and
stamps; cultivating victory gardens; and
adopting local servicemen. In 1954 Girl
scouting was integrated nationally; and
WHEREAS, a nationwide project,
Action 70, stimulated great interest in Girl
Scouting among inner-city groups. District 3
Girl Scout programs traditionally offered at
city neighborhood schools, were adversely
affected by the new desegregation plan, while
those Girl Scout programs centered in private
and parochial schools remained strong. To
counteract the loss of traditional troops in
public schools, GSCGSL developed
innovative programs which could be
implemented through churches, community
and youth centers. In 1976 a Day Camp in
District 3 was established as a collaborative
project with Ascension Episcopal Church; and
WHEREAS, District 3 increased its
collaboration with community agencies in its
role as advocate for youth. Issues involving
healthcare, crime prevention, juvenile justice,

troubled families, youth with disabilities,
energy conservation, and environmental
concerns received the attention and expertise
of the Girl Scout Organization. 1 In 996 more
than 70 administrative volunteers, council
trainers and staff members attended District
3’s annual dinner meeting a the Salad Bowl
Restaurant. This represents the commitment
and involvement of those volunteers who lead
and directed Girl Scouting in District 3; and

WHEREAS, through its flexibility and
integrity, its concern for girls and caring adults,
District 3 continues to demonstrate its
relevance and vitality in a contemporary
world. Girl Scouting was extended to homeless
shelters, offered special summer programs and
training opportunities for older girls and adults.
Rally Day Outreach programs were
implemented at facilities throughout the city
of St. Louis to give girls an opportunity to
learn about Girl Scouting. Today, Girl
Scouting in District 3 builds girls of courage,
confidence and character. Leaders and
volunteers work to improve the quality of life
for girls so they can discover their personal
best, connect with others and take action to
improve their communities.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize and honor the Girl
Scouts of Eastern Missouri-District 3and we
further direct the Clerk of this Board to spread
a copy of this Resolution across the minutes
of these proceedings and to prepare a
commemorative copy to the end that it may
be presented to our honoree at a time and
place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision on the same subject matter;
