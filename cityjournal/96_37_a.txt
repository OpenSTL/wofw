Resolution No. 171

Mary Jean Cox Pearson
WHEREAS, we pause in our
deliberations to note the passing of St. Louis
resident, Mary Jean Cox Pearson; and

WHEREAS, Mary Jean Cox Pearson,
beloved First Lady of the Newstead Avenue
Baptist Church, wife, mother, and teacher,
was born on March 1, 1943, in Humboldt,
Tennessee. She was the thirteenth of seventeen
children born to Willie and Lizzie Cox. Sister
Pearson, as she was affectionately called,
professed her love of Christ early in life and
never wavered in her faith; and

WHEREAS, in spite of the limited
opportunities for African Americans in the
South in the fifties and sixties, Mrs. Pearson
graduated from Lane College with a degree in
teaching in 1969. It was during this time that
she met Richard L. Pearson, Sr., an army
veteran and college student. Mr. Pearson knew
at first glance that the pretty young woman
with long hair and a cute walk would one day
be his wife. The couple married on June 21,
1970, and moved to St. Louis to start their
careers. Pastor Pearson, who was not yet a
“church-goer,” soon realized that Sister
Pearson was a committed Christian with super
strong faith in God. “It didn’t matter what
great plans I had on Sunday, such as going to
see a sports event; she would always direct
me to drop her off at church,” recalls Pastor
Pearson. He eventually decided to see what it
was that arrested her attention every Sunday.
Mrs. Pearson’s character and strength caused
him to start attending church each Sunday,
ultimately becoming a preacher and pastor, as
well as giving up vices such as alcohol and
cigarettes. The couple, blessed with two
children, Yolanda (Buford) Hawthorne and
Richard (Alicia) Jr., remained partners in life
for 43 years; and

WHEREAS, Mary Jean Pearson was a
dedicated elementary school teacher who
began her career at Dunbar Elementary School
in the Kinloch School District. She became
one of the first African Americans selected to
integrate the Parker Road Elementary School
in the Ferguson - Florissant School District.
She would go on to teach at Airport and
Bermuda elementary schools. She served her
students with devotion, integrity and love.
“She was an excellent teacher who did not
accept foolishness in her classroom. However,
she was equally caring; her spirit was very
Christ-like. I always knew she cared about
my future,” remarked a former student. Mrs.
Pearson, who worked under three
superintendents, including Dr. John Wright,
retired after 32 years of service; and

WHEREAS, First Lady Pearson was a
devoted member of the Newstead Avenue
Missionary Baptist Church, serving in several
ministries. In addition to being First Lady,
she was known for her lovely soprano voice,
and was one of the lead soloists in the music
ministry. She taught in the Sunday School
and Vacation Bible School ministries and was
a member of the Mother and Deaconess
Board, Women’s Missionary Union and the
Minister’s Wives Group of the Antioch
District. Sister Pearson shared the many
talents and gifts that God had bestowed upon
her with as many people as she could. Her life
was a testament to her strong faith in the Lord
Jesus Christ and the church, as well as her
belief in the importance of education; and
WHEREAS, Sister Pearson went into
the presence of the Lord on Friday, November
15, 2013, at Barnes Jewish Hospital, with her
family at her side. In addition to her husband
and children, she is survived by eight
grandchildren, Julian, Bria, Riara, Aliyah,
Justin, Tyler, Renelle and Nyla; her sisters
Georgia Mae Cole of Jackson, TN, Tommie
Lou (Robert) Allen of Jackson, TN, Christine
(Jim) Davis of Southfield, MI, Alberta Woody
of Memphis, TN, and Ida Bea (Franklin)
McFadden of Clarksville, TN; her brothers
Rev. Sammie Cox of Jackson, TN, Odell
(Shirley) Cox of Dayton, OH and Lloyd
(Fannie) Cox of Toledo, OH; and a host of
nieces, nephews, cousins, other family
members and friends; and
WHEREAS, she is preceded in death
by her parents, Willie and Lizzie Cox, four
brothers Clarence Cox, George Cox, Robert
Cox and Willie Cox; three sisters Donnie B.
Triggs, Constance Cox, and Juanita
Williamson.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause to
remember the many contributions of Mary
Jean Cox Pearson to the citizens of the City
of St. Louis and we join with her many friends
in expressing our sorrow at her passing, and
we further direct the Clerk of this Board to
spread a copy of this Resolution across the
minutes of these proceedings and to prepare a
memorial copy for presentation to the Pearson
family, at a time and place deemed appropriate
by the Sponsor.

Resolution No. 172

the insightful contributions and expert
knowledge of citizens throughout the St. Louis
community; and

WHEREAS, ours is a government of the
people, by the people and for the people one which welcomes ideas and ingenuity from
those passionately striving for the betterment
of our society and the effective administration
of its government; and

WHEREAS, JoAnn Williams has been
a fixture at St. Louis City Hall for more than
20 years; and

WHEREAS, her career has taken JoAnn
on a long and winding road through the inner
workings of state of local government and we
have witnessed JoAnn wearing many hats in
her service to this great city; and

WHEREAS, she has devoted boundless
time and energy to the improvement of St.
Louis through her work with the St. Louis
Housing Authority, the Employee Retirement
System and the countless committees, boards,
panels, commissions and working groups she
has generously volunteered to spearhead; and

WHEREAS, her most admirable
contribution and lasting legacy is the tireless
voice she has given to the hard-working men
and women - the City employees - who, with
little fanfare, cut the grass, staff the jails, clean
the parks, inspect the buildings, maintain the
airport, provide security and house the city’s
stray animals, and

WHEREAS, her institutional knowledge
of city government has, at times, eclipsed that
of even our elected officials; and

WHEREAS, her wisdom, willingness
and wit will be sorely missed by all of us who
have come to know and respect her.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED BY THE BOARD of Aldermen
of the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to congratulate JoAnn Williams
on the occasion of her retirement as Business
Representative for the Carpenters’ District
Council, wish her well in all her future
endeavors and thank her for her decades-long
commitment to the citizens of St. Louis and
we direct the Clerk of this Board to spread a
copy of this Resolution across the minutes of
these proceedings and to prepare a
commemorative copy to the end that it may
be presented to our honoree at a time and

Board, the Developer be granted one
(1) additional year of abatement to
compensate the Developer for the
construction of an additional

2. For purposes of calculating the tax
liability for the Subsequent
Improvements, any increase in the
assessment of any improvements,
from the assessment in effect for such
improvements as of January 1, 2011,
shall be deemed attributable to the
Subsequent Improvements.
3. In accordance with Section 135.215(1)
