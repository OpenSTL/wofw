Honorable Donna Baringer,Alderwoman 16thWard        
           Resolution No. 122                       
       Bishop Charlie Chatman                       
     WHEREAS, Bishop Chatman was a                  
family man, the father of five children and the     
husband of Queen Esther Chatman for fifty           
three years and ten months; and                     
      WHEREAS, he worked untiringly to              
give them what he thought they deserved;            
working many long over-time hours at the jobs       
he held in order to add the little extras to their  
lives; and                                          
      WHEREAS, Bishop Chatman was a                 
faithful man of God, dedicated to the work of       
the Lord. Four years into his pasturing, he         
became discouraged. With a handful of young         
people and a mountain of bills he decided that      
he had reached his limit; and                       
     WHEREAS, Bishop Chatman told his               
wife that he wanted to go on vacation               
somewhere he had never been; away from              
churches, simply because he had no plans to         
attend one while on vacation; and                   
      WHEREAS, the Lord dealt with Sister           
Chatman and told her to get him as close to         
Chicago, IL as possible; and with the help of       
her daughter they persuaded him to go out           
and take pictures of Elder Richard Henton's         
newly purchased church of which she was             
also a member; and                                  
      WHEREAS, on getting him there, he             
took out his camera for pictures. Sister            
Chatman ran up the steps and into church            
service knowing Bishop would follow. Elder          
Henton's message was for him: "It's worth           
it." In the middle of the message Bishop            
Chatman stood, raised his hands to God, and         
cried "Yes!"; and                                   
     WHEREAS, from that day he never                
looked backed, but pressed through every            
obstacle, believing "it was worth it"; and          
      WHEREAS, Bishop was a humble man              
who respected leadership and was loyal to           
his leaders. He went out of his way to be           
obedient to do whatever he could.                   
      WHEREAS, Bishop Chatman was an                
achiever. He held a certificate from St. Louis      
University in Electronics, diplomas from Basis      
Institute of Technology and Data Processing         
 and various degrees from Saints Academy          
 Bible College: an Associates Degree in Biblical  
 Studies, a Bachelors Degree in Christian         
 Ministries, a Masters Degree in Christian        
 Education and an Honorary Doctors Degree         
 of Letters L.H.D.                                
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

             ORDINANCE #69431                      
              Board Bill No. 295                   
     Committee Substitute As Amended               
       An Ordinance repealing Section One,         
 part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining        
 to the opening of bids, codified as Section       
 5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of       
 St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the    
 same subject matter which allows a local bidder   
 to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid       
 is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new        
 provision on the same subject matter;             
 containing severability clause.                   
       WHEREAS, local businesses which seek        
 to enter into contracts with the City of St.      
 Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with      
 businesses from other areas because of the        
 higher administrative costs of doing business     
 in the City;                                      
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis               
 desires to encourage businesses to remain in      
 the City and to relocate to the City;             
       WHEREAS, by enacting a local                
 preference law that allows a local firm to match  
 the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%          
 percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to      
 encourage and stimulate local business.           
      BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF                
 ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                             
      SECTION ONE. Section One, part               
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.       
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                 
 thereof is the following new section.             
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                  
      A. Proposals shall be opened at the time     
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the      
 presence of such bidders as desire to be         
 present, and shall be open to the inspection     
 of bidders.                                      
       B. The bids shall not be materially        
 modified or amended as to price, specification   
 or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,  
 after opening except when the lowest bid is      
 from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid     
 is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder     
 within two percent of the lowest bid may         
 match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches  
 the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner     
 may select the bid from the local bidder. If     
 more than one local bidder is within two         
 percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest  
 local bidder may match the bid. In all other     
 circumstances, modification, supplementation     
 or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.   
 For purposes of this chapter, local bidder       
 means a bidder whose principal place of          
 business is within the City of St. Louis, has    
 had a valid business license for at least one    
 year, and is current in payment of local taxes.  
 Principal place of business shall be defined as  
 the business's physical office, plant, or site   
 where a majority (51%) of the full-time          
 employees, chief officer, and managers of the    
 business regularly work and conduct business,    
 or where the plant or office and equipment       
 required for the furnishing of the goods or      
 performance of the services provided to the      
 City, as required by the contract, are physically
 located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
 taxable year immediately prior to the date of    
 the bid.                                         
       C. Bids may be for one or more or all the  
 articles advertised for, but there shall be a    
 specific bid on each article. The award may be   
 made to the lowest bidder for any article, or    
 to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition  
 or any part thereof, but the Board of            
 Standardization may reject any or all bids or    
 any part of any bid.                             
      SECTION THREE. Severability.                
       The provisions of this section are         
 severable. If any provision of this ordinance    
 is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not   
 affect other provisions of the ordinance which   
 can be given effect without the invalid          
 provision.                                       
 Approved: April 29, 2013                         
      The right to reject any and all bids is     
 reserved
