 Guard; and                                      
       WHEREAS, when his service with the        
 armed forces was over, he continued to serve    
 as a member of the American Legion. For the     
 past 25 years he has served in many positions.  
 He was Post Commander in 1998 and again in      
 2009. He has been Post Adjutant for at least    
 ten years, plus he has at one time or another

 chits to the patients at the Jefferson Barracks 
 V.A. Hospital. Skip worked for a number of      
 years with the Soldiers Memorial and has

       WHEREAS, Legionnaire Berger was           
 responsible for the World War I Memorial at     
 Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery. This      
 memorial has reached a significant goal of      
 preserving a vital piece of St. Louis history to
 honor the fallen WWI soldiers and the mothers   
 who loved them. After WWI the Gold Star         
 Mothers of St. Louis created a Court of Honor,  
 with bronze medallions set into the parkway     
 in the middle of North Kingshighway             
 Boulevard representing every St. Louisan who    
 died in WWI; and                                
      WHEREAS, in the 1980's these              
medallions were being thrown away. Skip,        
along with other members of Rolla-Calcaterra,   
Post 15 saved 752 of the original 1,185 bronze  
plaques and he personally documented the        
433 that were lost. Since that time Skip has    
had a single mission to find an appropriate     
home for the medallions. As of September        
30, 2012 his mission has been fulfilled. That   
Sunday, which was also Gold Star Mother's       
Day, was the day the World War I Court of       
Honor Memorial was officially dedicated at      
Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery. This      
was also the day Skip's dreams became           
finalized; and                                  
      WHEREAS, Skip also worked to restore      
a truck in memory of L. Cpl. Phillip Vinnedge   
a Marine who lost his life in Iraq. Julie,      
Phillip's mother is also the president of the   
St. Louis Gold Star Mothers; and                
     WHEREAS, the 11/12 District of St.         
Louis, Department of Missouri, of the

             ORDINANCE #69431                      
              Board Bill No. 295                   
     Committee Substitute As Amended               
       An Ordinance repealing Section One,         
 part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining        
 to the opening of bids, codified as Section       
 5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of       
 St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the    
 same subject matter which allows a local bidder   
 to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid       
 is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new        
 provision on the same subject matter;             
 containing severability clause.                   
       WHEREAS, local businesses which seek        
 to enter into contracts with the City of St.      
 Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with      
 businesses from other areas because of the        
 higher administrative costs of doing business     
 in the City;                                      
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis               
 desires to encourage businesses to remain in      
 the City and to relocate to the City;             
       WHEREAS, by enacting a local                
 preference law that allows a local firm to match  
 the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%          
 percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to     
 encourage and stimulate local business.          
      BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF               
 ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                            
      SECTION ONE. Section One, part              
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.      
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                
 thereof is the following new section.            
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                 
       A. Proposals shall be opened at the time   
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the     
 presence of such bidders as desire to be         
 present, and shall be open to the inspection     
 of bidders.                                      
       B. The bids shall not be materially        
 modified or amended as to price, specification   
 or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,  
 after opening except when the lowest bid is      
 from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid     
 is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder     
 within two percent of the lowest bid may         
 match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches  
 the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner     
 may select the bid from the local bidder. If     
 more than one local bidder is within two         
 percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest  
 local bidder may match the bid. In all other     
 circumstances, modification, supplementation     
 or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.   
 For purposes of this chapter, local bidder       
 means a bidder whose principal place of          
 business is within the City of St. Louis, has    
 had a valid business license for at least one    
 year, and is current in payment of local taxes.  
 Principal place of business shall be defined as  
 the business's physical office, plant, or site   
 where a majority (51%) of the full-time          
 employees, chief officer, and managers of the    
 business regularly work and conduct business,    
 or where the plant or office and equipment       
 required for the furnishing of the goods or      
 performance of the services provided to the      
 City, as required by the contract, are physically
 located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
 taxable year immediately prior to the date of    
 the bid.                                         
       C. Bids may be for one or more or all the  
 articles advertised for, but there shall be a    
 specific bid on each article. The award may be   
 made to the lowest bidder for any article, or    
 to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition  
 or any part thereof, but the Board of            
 Standardization may reject any or all bids or    
 any part of any bid.                             
      SECTION THREE. Severability.                
      The provisions of this section are          
 severable. If any provision of this ordinance    
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can be given effect without the invalid       
provision.                                    
Approved: April 29, 2013                      
     The right to reject any and all bids is  
reserved
