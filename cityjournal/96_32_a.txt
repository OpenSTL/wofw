Resolution No. 139
Mother Geneva Gentry
WHEREAS, Mother Geneva Gentry
was born on May 12, 1912 in Waynesboro,
Mississippi. She was the only child born to
the late Daisy (Robinson) Dent. Mother
Gentry dedicated her life to the Lord at an
early age. She moved to St. Louis with her
mother at the age of nine. She was one of the
first students to attend the Vashon High School
at its original location on Laclede Avenue.
Mother Gentry married the late Joshua Gentry
in 1942. To this union two children were
born, Lt. Col. (Ret.) Joseph Gentry and Dr.
Marabeth Gentry. After 48 years of marriage,
the Lord called Brother Gentry home on
March 27, 1990; and

WHEREAS, at the age of 14, after an
invitation from Reverend Pa Allen, she joined
Christ’s Southern Mission Baptist Church
under the Pastorate of the late Reverend
Herman Gore, Sr. Mother Gentry had great

Lamarr Goldman. At Christ’s Southern
Mission, she served as President of the Willing
Workers Ministry for over 60 years, member
of the Mother’s Board, sponsor of the Mother
Gore’s Mission (MGM) Ministry, Mother
of the Adult Choir and served on the Board of
the Mother Gore Scholarship Committee.
Under Reverend Gore’s leadership, she became

was as a member of the Golden Voice Team
which was an evangelistic singing ministry;
and
WHEREAS, in 1939, Mother Gentry
became active in the National Convention of
Gospel Choirs and Choruses, Inc. (NCGCC)

which was founded by the late Dr. Thomas A.
Dorsey. It was at the Dorsey Convention
where Mother Gentry was introduced by the
late Madam Fannie Foster to the handsome
and illustrious Joshua Gentry, the love of her
life. Mother Gentry loved young people; it
was out of this love that following the death
of Brother Gentry, she started a scholarship
fund at the NCGCC in his name to aid young
people in reaching their educational goals.
Mother Gentry served as the National
Consecration Coordinator for the convention.
She was the oldest living member and beloved
Mother of the convention. As the Lord would
have it, Mother Gentry along with her spiritual
son, the late Bishop Kenneth H. Moales, Sr.
attended their last convention together in
Orlando, Florida in August of 2010. In 1943,

national gospel artists; and

WHEREAS, in the community, Mother
Gentry was a Charter Member and Chaplain
in the 1960s and 70s of the Yeatman District
Community Corporation and helped organize
the Yeatman Parent-Child Center. This center

she had a fond love for). She served as CoChairman of the Women’s Division of the Billy
Graham Crusade in 1973. She also gave service
to the Salvation Army’s Harbor Light Mission
which began in 1967. Mother Gentry was a
member and volunteer worker for the Home
Mission and Evangelistic Board of the National
Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. She was a
Lifetime Member of the Board of Volunteers
of the Metropolitan Psychiatric Center
(formally known as Malcolm-Bliss). She also
worked for many years with the late Reverend
Joseph D. Linton and the Progressive Baptist
Church in their Food for the Hungry Outreach
Program; and

WHEREAS, Mother Gentry received
numerous awards for her work, some of which
included: Gospel Historian Music Award, Dr.
Martin Luther King Pioneer Award, Gospel
Pioneer Award presented by the Announcers

America, a Lifetime Certificate of Membership
to the Gospel Music Workshop of America
presented to her by Founder, the late Reverend
James Cleveland, 50 Year Service Award from
the National Convention of Gospel Choirs
and Choruses, Washington University
Continuing Education Award, the Clarence
Hayden Music Guild Award, the Heritage
Award from the McDonalds Gospel Fest, the
MGM Dedicated Service Award and many
others, too numerous to name; and

WHEREAS, Mother Geneva Gentry
lived a long and glorious life; “A Legacy of
Love” in which she shared kind smiles,
encouraging words, a listening ear and spiritual
guidance to many in the St. Louis metropolitan
area as well as across the length and breadth
of this country. This “Legacy of Love”
continues through her son, Lt. Col. (Ret.)
Joseph Gentry and her daughter, Dr. Marabeth
Gentry; two granddaughters, Stephanie
Gentry and Janeen (Duane) Gentry-Bowen;
four great-grandchildren; two great-great
grandchildren and a host of cousins, spiritual
children, her Christ’s Southern Mission
family, her NCGCC family and many friends.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause to
remember the many contributions of Mother
Geneva Gentry to the citizens of the City of
St. Louis and we join with her many friends in
expressing our sorrow at her passing, and we
