            Resolution No. 210                      
         The 100th Anniversary                      
          of St. John the Baptist                   
      WHEREAS, John the Baptist Parish              
 was organized on December 30, 1913, with           
 the appointment of Father John Peters as           
 pastor. The first Mass celebrated in the parish    
 took place on February 1, 1914 at 4626             
 Gravois. Shortly thereafter land was bought        
 on Delor and Adkins Streets and ground was       
 broken for a building later called Sodality Hall;
 and                                              
       WHEREAS, St. John the Baptist              
 Elementary School opened in September with       
 the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood of        
 O'Fallon teaching in the classrooms in the hall. 
 The cornerstone for a combination of school      
 and church was laid in August 1914 and was       
 completed in November 1914. The sisters          
 lived in the rear of the building while Father   
 Peters lived in Sodality Hall. In 1916, the      
 parish purchased six lots on Adkins Street       
 and Father Peters personally bought a house      
 as a rectory. A second floor was added to        
 Sodality Hall in 1917, as more classrooms were   
 needed. An addition was made to the sisters'     
 residence. The parish purchased Father Peters'   
 house in 1924 and it was used as the rectory     
 until 1957; and                                  
       WHEREAS, a new building was                
 constructed south of the church in 1922 and      
 this was the beginning of St. John the Baptist   
 High School. By 1930, the school was a four      
 year accredited parish High School. The          
 present church was started in 1924 and           
 completed in 1930 with the erection of the       
 bell tower. The old church was then converted    
 in to classrooms and more rooms for the          
 sisters. Within a period of 16 years, the parish 
 had built five buildings, including adding to    
 many of them, established and supported an       
 elementary school and high school and acquired   
 land for further expansion; and                  
       WHEREAS, during the next 16 years          
 the high school program expanded and eight       
 more classrooms were added in 1934. In 1938,     
 the gym, cafeteria and four more classrooms      
 were added. In 1946, another wing was added      
 to the house, the library, and additional        
 classrooms as well. In 1957, a new Rectory       
 was built and an addition was added to the       
 convent in 1959. The elementary school was       
 becoming outdated and a new building was         
 started in 1963 and completed in 1964; and       
       WHEREAS, in 2005, Resurrection of          
 Our Lord Parish and Holy Family Parish           
 merged to become what today is the Parish        
 family of St. John the Baptist. The original     
 shrine from Holy Family Parish was installed     
 in the back of church in 2005; and               
      WHEREAS, in 2007, the inside of the         
 church underwent major renovation and            
 restoration. In 2008, St. John the Baptist       
 High School closed its doors officially. The     
 Perpetual Help shrine was installed in the       
 Summer of 2008 as well. In Fall 2009, St.        
 John the Baptist Elementary and Pre-School       
 moved in to what was once the old St. John       
the Baptist High School building; and            
      WHEREAS, in January 2011, in honor         
of the episcopal appointment of the previous     
pastor, they have dedicated their Adoration      
Chapel in Bishop Rice's name. A sign with        
this designation has been placed above the       
entrance to the Adoration Chapel.                
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
RESOLVED BY the Board of Aldermen of

assignments to include Patrol Support and        
Special Services and various district            
assignments to include the 2nd, 3rd, 5th and     
8th Districts. Although his policing foundation  
began in the 8th District, he has fostered       
strong relationships with local residents and    
business owners/leaders in the 5th District.     
He has also been instrumental in the

many, utmost in his repertoire is his strong     
administrative skills and insuring the

preparing Central Patrol Division's              
Commanders Schedule and developed forms

operations. Under his leadership, several        
Officers received the Officer of the Year Award

leadership abilities. These are a few reasons    
why he is deserving of the 5th District A        
Platoon Lieutenant Leadership Award for

        WHEREAS, during the calendar year of         
 2013, Officers Jarrod Henderson and Sean            
 James distinguished themselves by showing           
 their true dedication to the citizens of the Fifth  
 District. Officer James is a 13 year veteran,       
 while Officer Henderson has 8 years with the        
 department; and                                     
       WHEREAS, as a duo, for the year 2013,         
 these two officers handled a total of 2,492         
 calls for service, wrote 186 police reports, 68     
 traffic summonses, 36 parking tags, and made        
 41 arrests for 34 felony charges 16                 
 misdemeanor, and 57 city ordinance violations;      
 and                                                 
       WHEREAS, Their exceptional                    
 performance, going above and beyond the call        
 of duty, did not go unnoticed. Their hard           
 work and dedication is recognized by those          
 they work with, as well as the citizens of the      
 Fifth District; and                                 
       WHEREAS, although these officers              
 perform their duties with exceptional               
 consistency, they remain motivated to go the        
 extra mile; and                                     
       WHEREAS, during the month of                  
 December, Officer Henderson was on patrol           
 with another Fifth District officer, when they      
 observed a 2001 Dodge Neon driving                  
 erratically. They activated their emergency         
 lights and attempted to stop the vehicle. The       
 driver abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot.      
 Officer Henderson exited his police vehicle         
 and gave chase. After a lengthy foot pursuit,       
 the driver was taken into custody. The vehicle      
 was reported stolen the day before and the        
 juvenile suspect had a prior history of stealing  
 vehicles. After completing the necessary          
 paperwork, Officer Henderson also went to         
 the juvenile suspect's home, and summonsed        
 the suspect's mother for "Endangering the         
 Welfare of a Child" for her lack of parental      
 supervision; and                                  
       WHEREAS, in another incident during         
 the month of May, Officers James and              
 Henderson observed a large group of female        
 and male subjects arguing in the 2700 block of    
 Coleman. A juvenile male then ran from the        
 scene and Officer James observed the juvenile     
 subject running while holding a silver handgun    
 in his hand. After a short foot chase, the        
 juvenile was taken into custody and the           
 handgun was recovered. A female subject was       
 located who made a written statement              
 admitting to giving the handgun to the juvenile   
 and telling him to run. She was arrested and      
 the juvenile was released into the custody of     
 his mother. Charges were later issued against     
 the female by the Circuit Attorney's Office;      
 and                                               
       WHEREAS, these two officers have            
 made a very positive impact on crime in the       
 Fifth District. Their continuous efforts and      
 dedication have made the Fifth District a safer   
 place for all. They have gained the admiration    
 of their peers and they are fine examples of      
 what younger officers should strive to be.        
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

         Sergeant Craig Layton                     
       WHEREAS, Sergeant Craig Layton was          
 nominated for the 5th District Leadership

 what Captain Mary Edwards-Fears considers         
 an outstanding display of leadership in law       
 enforcement. His leadership exemplifies his       
 dedication, perseverance and genuine desire       
 to serve the Department and the community;

 Sergeant Layton leads by example. His             
 dedication and professionalism stand as           
 benchmarks for the Officers assigned to him.

 this time the Fifth District was plagued with     
 a rash of street robberies. Under the             
 supervision of Sergeant Layton the Fifth          
 District Detectives focused their investigation   
 on these robberies leading to the arrest of       
 several suspects. These arrests, directly led     
 to a reduction of street robberies in the Fifth   
 District; and

           Resolution No. 224                      
 Detective Sergeant Mark A. Sorocko                
      WHEREAS, Detective Sergeant Mark             
A. Sorocko was nominated for the 5th District      
Leadership Award due to his dedication and         
commitment to excellence. Detective Sergeant       
Sorocko joined the St. Louis Metropolitan          
Police Dept., in 1989 with his first assignment    
being the Mobile Reserve Unit where he             
learned the tactical fundamentals of becoming      
an effective Police Officer; and                   
      WHEREAS, he has held various                 
assignments to include Vice-Narcotics and          
Crime Against Persons and various district         
assignments to include the 3rd, 4th, and 5th       
Districts. It was his start in the Mobile          
Reserve Unit that taught him the best practices    
in high risk car stops and in removing             
dangerous weapons and gang members from            
the community streets. He has served the 5th       
District in at least 3 different capacities; as a  
Patrolman and as Detective Sergeant, and           
often targeting trouble spots in the district      
during his stints in Mobile Reserve and Crime      
Against Persons; and                               
      WHEREAS, Detective Sergeant Sorocko          
does an exemplary job of managing the 5th          
District Bureau Detectives, and providing          
direction and guidance when needed, which          
has resulted in several notable cases being        
solved due to his team's involvement i.e.          
assaults, murders, (street and bank) robberies     
and burglaries. He welcomes the challenge of       
assisting Detectives overcome their individual     
struggles and become valued members of the         
department; and                                    
     WHEREAS, although his talents are             
many, utmost in his repertoire are his strong      
investigative skills and his relentless nature in  
lending assistance to neighboring districts/       
units when needed. Under his leadership,           
several high profile cases were solved:            
Investigation into the (improper) disposal of      
a human corpse led to a Murder 2nd Degree          
charge being issued against a drug dealer for      
his role in the death of a College Hill            
Neighborhood resident. In another case, in         
 2009, District Officers were fired upon by        
 fleeing robbery suspects, arresting one suspect   
 at that time. In an unrelated investigation in    
 2013, his Detectives unearthed the identities     
 of two remaining suspects who were taken          
 into custody and charged accordingly. These       
 are a few reasons why he is deserving of the      
 5th District Leadership Award for 2013.           
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                          
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of              
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

             Resolution No. 223                   
     WHEREAS, the Red, Black and Green,           
was first established August 13, 1920 by the      
Universal Negro Improvement Association           
(UNIA), then centered in Harlem, New York         
during the Harlem Renaissance as a way to         
denote and highlight Africa and her people;       
and                                               
      WHEREAS, the flag is tri-color              
consisting of three equal portions from top to    
bottom. The red represents the blood that         
unites all people of Black African ancestry.      
The Black represents black people whose

state and the green represents the abundant       
natural wealth of Africa; and

reliance organization of its time in the western  
hemisphere with chapters in the United States,    
the Caribbean, Central and South America later    
establishing chapters throughout Africa, and      
      WHEREAS, the Red, Black and Green,          
as it was officially called by UNIA, over the     
years, came to represent freedom and              
liberation and grew in great popularity during    
the movement for equality, cultural expression    
and self-determination, economic                  
opportunity, and the ending of discrimination     
during the justice movement of the 1960s and      
70s, and                                          
       WHEREAS, some combination of the            
 basic colors of this flag have been incorporated  
 into the national flags of nearly every newly     
 independent African and Caribbean nation          
 after they fought and won their freedom from      
 colonial rule, and                                
       WHEREAS, The Republic of South              
 Africa was the most recent African Nation         
 freed from racial discrimination brought on       
 by colonialism to incorporate these colors into   
 their new united flag of a free South Africa,     
 and                                               
       WHEREAS, the Red, Black and Green           
 has also become one of the symbols of African-    
 American History Month representing the           
 rich culture, contributions, achievements and     
 struggles the African-American experience, and    
       WHEREAS, the Red, Black and Green           
 is used, displayed and flown in various public    
 places throughout the United States during        
 African-American History Month including          
 public schools, government offices, churches,     
 business and organizations as a way to both

 contributions African- Americans have made        
 to the world and the American experience.         
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                          
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen for

           OF RESOLUTIONS                          
      Ms. Tyus introduced Resolution No.           
 200 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.    
            Resolution No. 200                    
       WHEREAS, This January 2014, The            
 City of St. Louis experienced some of the worst  
 cold weather and accumulated snowfall in         
 several decades; and                             
       WHEREAS, We all appreciate the             
 dedicated hard work and long hours that the      
 employees of the City of St. Louis extended      
 attempting to remove the snow from our city      
 streets, especially the Street Department        
 employees of whom some worked 12 hour            
 shifts; and                                      
      WHEREAS, Although the low                   
 temperatures and large amounts of                
 accumulated snowfall is unusual for The City     
 of St. Louis, it is not unheard of or            
 unprecedented; and                               
      WHEREAS, Over the years, the City           
 of St. Louis has experienced several separate    
 periods during the Winter Seasons (December      
 21- March 20) when there were large amounts      
 of snowfall; and                                 
       WHEREAS, Although the Executive            
 Branch of the City of St. Louis, specifically,   
 the Mayor's Office appoints the Director of      
 Streets whose title is Street Commissioner and   
 who reports directly to the Mayor, the Street    
 Commissioner should also work with and keep      
 informed the Legislative Branch in the City      
 of St. Louis which is known as The Board of      
 Aldermen; and                                    
       WHEREAS, The Street Commissioner           
 should make sure that the City of St. Louis      
 has a snow removal plan that when                
 implemented would ensure that snow removal       
 in the City would be done in an orderly, timely  
 fair manner across the entire City of St. Louis  
 so that the residents and those doing business   
 with our fair city or just visiting could as soon
 as possible return to their everyday activities  
 such as going to work, school, and church and    
       WHEREAS, It is of the utmost               
 importance that this snow removal plan be in     
 writing and disseminated to the Legislative      
 Branch of the City of St. Louis along with       
 other elected Officials and the general public   
 at large; and                                    
       WHEREAS, The current written Snow          
 Removal Policy of the City of St. Louis is to    
 pretreat the City's Snow Routes with a brine     
 solution and once the snow begins to fall, the   
 plow/salt trucks are to make their rounds        
 treating and plowing as necessary. Also, if      
 the forecast calls for several days of below-    
 freezing temperatures and little sunshine,       
 indicating snow will not be melting away         
 quickly, crews are to salt residential           
 intersections to ensure safe stopping.; and      
      WHEREAS, Additionally, the written          
snow removal policy goes on to state Plowing      
Residential streets is NOT FEASIBLE               
(emphasis added) as the streets are too           
narrow, often tire ruts are already formed by     
traffic preventing the City's ability to push     
the snow, and the difficulty plowing presents     
for residents parked on the street getting        
plowed in; and                                    
      WHEREAS, Lastly, the written snow           
removal policy states that the above              
procedures are in place for all snow/ice events   
in the City of St. Louis and instructs our        
Citizens that is it is not necessary to call to   
get their street treated and the above stated     
snow removal policy was repeated by many          
members of this esteemed Board to their           
constituents in their respective wards when       
the constituents called regarding snow            
removal on their streets and in their             
neighborhoods during this past snow storm;        
and                                               
      WHEREAS, When the written Snow              
Removal Plan for the City of St. Louis was        
changed it was particularly important that not    
only should the general public be advised but     
also ALL MEMBERS of the Legislative Body          
known as the BOARD OF ALDERMEN                    
should have been advised of said change so        
that they may have properly informed their        
many constituents to the changes in the plan      
in connection with what the Executive Branch      
and Street Commissioner were telling the          
regarding the current snow removal policy for     
the City ; and                                    
     WHEREAS, The residents and business          
across the City of St. Louis pay taxes and        
expect that they will all receive the same basic  
City Service including snow removal in a          
timely fair fashion in every neighborhood of      
the City of St. Louis; and                        
      WHEREAS, Throughout the City there          
were many citizens who expressed                  
disappointment and dismay at the lack of snow     
removal in their neighborhoods and                
communities. Many Citizens stating specific       
reasons for their disappointment such as, the     
snow routes in areas where they lived or          
worked were not properly cleaned; the             
secondary streets were not treated and plowed     
or cleaned; there was a lack of access to the     
bus stops because the bus stops because they      
were packed with snow; residential                
intersections were not salted; the lack of        
timeliness of when the City decided they          
would plow residential streets, and the           
apparent lack of a plan to address removing       
the large amount of snow; and                     
     WHEREAS, It is the best interest of the      
 Citizens of St. Louis that we seek ways that    
 we as a City can improve upon our snow          
 removal and plan by reexamine our written       
 policy, especially as it relates to large       
 accumulations of snowfall and cold weather,     
 by evaluating our recent response to the snow,  
 and by seeking input from the Citizens of our   
 fair City as how we can better serve them in    
 the removal of snow, so that all of our         
 constituents have confidence that their         
 neighborhoods and communities are receiving     
 the same services and being treated fairly.

 ("Ordinance") and the Regulations associated     
 therewith, the City Compliance Official for      
the City of St. Louis has determined that the     
following living wage rates are now in effect     
for employees of covered contracts:

         employee, the living wage rate is        
         $12.21 per hour (130% of the federal     
         poverty level income guideline for a     
         family of three); and                    
   2)    Where health benefits as defined in      
         the Ordinance are not provided to        
         the employee, the living wage rate is    
         $15.92 per hour (130% of the federal     
         poverty level income guideline for a

pursuant to Chapter 6.20 of the Revised Code      
of the City of St. Louis.

              Board Bill No. 295                
     Committee Substitute As Amended            
       An Ordinance repealing Section One,      
 part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining     
 to the opening of bids, codified as Section    
 5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of    
 St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the 
 same subject matter which allows a local bidder
 to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid    
 is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new     
 provision on the same subject matter;          
 containing severability clause.                
       WHEREAS, local businesses which seek     
 to enter into contracts with the City of St.   
 Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with   
 businesses from other areas because of the     
 higher administrative costs of doing business  
 in the City;                                   
     WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis                
desires to encourage businesses to remain in       
the City and to relocate to the City;              
      WHEREAS, by enacting a local                 
preference law that allows a local firm to match   
the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%           
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to       
encourage and stimulate local business.            
     BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF                 
ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                              
     SECTION ONE. Section One, part                
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.        
     SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                  
thereof is the following new section.              
     5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                   
      A. Proposals shall be opened at the time     
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the       
presence of such bidders as desire to be           
present, and shall be open to the inspection       
of bidders.                                        
      B. The bids shall not be materially          
modified or amended as to price, specification     
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,    
after opening except when the lowest bid is        
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid       
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder       
within two percent of the lowest bid may           
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches    
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner       
may select the bid from the local bidder. If       
more than one local bidder is within two           
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest    
local bidder may match the bid. In all other       
circumstances, modification, supplementation       
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.     
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder         
means a bidder whose principal place of            
business is within the City of St. Louis, has      
had a valid business license for at least one      
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.    
Principal place of business shall be defined as    
the business's physical office, plant, or site     
where a majority (51%) of the full-time            
employees, chief officer, and managers of the      
business regularly work and conduct business,      
or where the plant or office and equipment         
required for the furnishing of the goods or        
performance of the services provided to the        
City, as required by the contract, are physically  
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one  
taxable year immediately prior to the date of      
the bid.                                           
      C. Bids may be for one or more or all the    
articles advertised for, but there shall be a      
specific bid on each article. The award may be     
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or      
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition    
 or any part thereof, but the Board of         
 Standardization may reject any or all bids or 
 any part of any bid.                          
      SECTION THREE. Severability.             
       The provisions of this section are      
 severable. If any provision of this ordinance 
 is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
 affect other provisions of the ordinance which
 can be given effect without the invalid       
 provision.                                    
 Approved: April 29, 2013                      
      The right to reject any and all bids is  
 reserved
