       WHEREAS, the Compton Hill                   
 Missionary Baptist Church was founded in          
 1860 and first met in a home in the 3200 block    
 of LaSalle Street. The congregation was           
 officially incorporated in 1892 and moved into    
 its current location at 3141 LaSalle Street; and  
      WHEREAS, Compton Hill Missionary             
 Baptist Church represents the heritage of the     
 African American community of Compton             
 Hill, one of the several distinct African         
 American neighborhoods of the city                
 established during the 19th century; and          
       WHEREAS, the building's new front           
 was designed by African American architect        
 John R. Steele in 1944. John R. Steele is         
 considered a pioneer that opened the way for      
 other African Americans to become architects;     
 and                                               
     WHEREAS, the congregation hosted the          
 Missouri State Missionary Baptist                 
 Convention in 1906, an event in its long history  
 of being active in the Berean District            
 Missionary Baptist Association; and               
      WHEREAS, many pastors have led the           
 church, including Reverend J. W. Mahomes,         
 who served from 1939 to 1966, who oversaw         
 the 1944 construction project and Pastor          
 Nathaniel Bland (1966-2013), under whose          
 long leadership of forty-two years additional     
 improvements were made to the church; and         
      WHEREAS, Compton Hill M. B.                  
 Church has been more than a significant           
 contribution to the stability of this             
 neighborhood because it is more than a            
 building. Compton Hill M.B. Church is a           
 "heart" that beats perpetually, consistently,     
 and compassionately through its members.          
      NOW THEREFORE IT BE

a Northsider through and through. In his         
younger days he was stronger and smarter         
than most and so he lived for himself. As a      
product of the hippie movement, Don's            
concept of love was that if you don't cross      
him, he wouldn't cross you. But all that         
changed in 1982; and                             
     WHEREAS, Don Sharp met Jesus. The           
former atheist ran up and down his street        
crying out "It's true It's TRUE! He never        
looked back. God transformed this man and        
his perception of love; and                      
       WHEREAS, he would spend the rest of       
his life at a small church in Baden called The   
Church of God at Baden. During those early       
years God began to give Don a heart that loved   
people, especially the poor and downtrodden;     
and                                              
     WHEREAS, he started feeding homeless        
people with his family at night. This only       
increased his hunger to help those in need. So   
Don began bringing these new ministries to       
The Church of God at Baden; and                  
       WHEREAS, in 1994 the church elected       
Don as their Pastor. Pastor Don's heart          
radically changed the mission and focus of       
that little church. The ministry began to focus  
far less with its walls and far more outside of  
them, into the community; and                    
      WHEREAS, under Pastor Don's                
inspiration and leadership, the Church of God    
at Baden began an official Homeless Ministry,    
a Food Bank, Telephone Ministry and a            
Clothing Ministry. The church began              
delivering Meals on Wheels during the holidays   
when the program was not available. Pastor       
Don also began providing transportation for      
elders to events in Baden; and                   
     WHEREAS, his heart for the needy,           
downtrodden and often forgotten souls was        
evident in his leading of Recovery Group         
meetings and Rehabilitation/Addiction            
 outreach. His counseling was sought by many       
 from all walks of life. But it was his love,      
 compassion and acceptance of people "right        
 where they are" that drew in the hurting souls;   
 and                                               
       WHEREAS, Pastor Don spearheaded             
 the Church of God at Baden's "Jesus in the        
 City" annual festival. He wanted this outreach    
 to draw people in from the county to              
 participate in ministering to the Baden           
 neighborhood. The festival includes live          
 music, free clothing, food and many activities    
 for children; and                                 
       WHEREAS, he was the Chairman of the         
 Board for the Baden Christian Childcare           
 Center. Through his ministry, he was able to      
 assist and interact with many parents in North    
 St. Louis over the years. Those relationships     
 didn't end when the children grew up; and         
       WHEREAS, of course, as Pastor, he led       
 numerous Bible studies on different days that     
 were personalized and themed for the needs        
 of the attendees. His Sunday morning              
 messages were always dipped in the message        
 of loving your neighbor as yourself and loving    
 your God with all your heart. He preached         
 the gospel in our 13 missionary churches in       
 Japan. When the Japanese Pastors came to          
 visit Baden, Pastor Don involved them in all      
 of our street ministries; and                     
      WHEREAS, his heart and mission               
 extended far beyond the bounds of a church        
 and the title "Pastor". If he had money in his    
 pocket, he gave it away. His home was always      
 shelter for low income and homeless people.       
 But most importantly, he was genuine. If          
 you met him, you could call him friend; and       
      WHEREAS, for those of us who knew            
 him day to day, we just called him Don. The       
 Pastor title was unnecessary because the love     
 of God so permeated this man, you couldn't        
 help but notice. He had one motivation and        
 that was to serve God. His successful life is     
 evidenced now in the words of those who           
 knew him - "He was the perfect example of         
 what I think a Christian ought to be".            
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of              
 the City of St. Louis that we pause to            
 remember the many contributions of Pastor         
 Carvin Donald Sharp to the citizens of the        
 City of St. Louis and we join with his many       
 friends in expressing our sorrow at his passing,  
 and we further direct the Clerk of this Board     
 to spread a copy of this Resolution across the    
 minutes of these proceedings and to prepare a     
 memorial copy for presentation to the Sharp       
 family, at a time and place deemed appropriate    
 by the Sponsor

             ORDINANCE #69431                      
              Board Bill No. 295                   
     Committee Substitute As Amended               
       An Ordinance repealing Section One,         
 part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining        
 to the opening of bids, codified as Section       
 5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of       
 St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the    
 same subject matter which allows a local bidder   
 to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid       
 is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new        
 provision on the same subject matter;             
 containing severability clause.                   
       WHEREAS, local businesses which seek        
 to enter into contracts with the City of St.      
 Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with      
 businesses from other areas because of the        
 higher administrative costs of doing business     
 in the City;                                      
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis               
 desires to encourage businesses to remain in      
 the City and to relocate to the City;             
       WHEREAS, by enacting a local                
 preference law that allows a local firm to match  
 the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%          
 percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to      
 encourage and stimulate local business.           
      BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF                
 ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                             
      SECTION ONE. Section One, part               
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.       
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                 
 thereof is the following new section.             
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                  
       A. Proposals shall be opened at the time    
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the      
 presence of such bidders as desire to be          
 present, and shall be open to the inspection      
 of bidders.                                       
       B. The bids shall not be materially         
 modified or amended as to price, specification    
 or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,   
 after opening except when the lowest bid is       
 from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid      
 is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder      
 within two percent of the lowest bid may          
 match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches   
 the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner      
 may select the bid from the local bidder. If     
 more than one local bidder is within two         
 percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest  
 local bidder may match the bid. In all other     
 circumstances, modification, supplementation     
 or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.   
 For purposes of this chapter, local bidder       
 means a bidder whose principal place of          
 business is within the City of St. Louis, has    
 had a valid business license for at least one    
 year, and is current in payment of local taxes.  
 Principal place of business shall be defined as  
 the business's physical office, plant, or site   
 where a majority (51%) of the full-time          
 employees, chief officer, and managers of the    
 business regularly work and conduct business,    
 or where the plant or office and equipment       
 required for the furnishing of the goods or      
 performance of the services provided to the      
 City, as required by the contract, are physically
 located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
 taxable year immediately prior to the date of    
 the bid.                                         
       C. Bids may be for one or more or all the  
 articles advertised for, but there shall be a    
 specific bid on each article. The award may be   
 made to the lowest bidder for any article, or    
 to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition  
 or any part thereof, but the Board of            
 Standardization may reject any or all bids or    
 any part of any bid.                             
      SECTION THREE. Severability.                
       The provisions of this section are         
 severable. If any provision of this ordinance    
 is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not   
 affect other provisions of the ordinance which   
 can be given effect without the invalid          
 provision.                                       
 Approved: April 29, 2013                         
      The right to reject any and all bids is     
 reserved
