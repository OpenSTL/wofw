COURTESY RESOLUTIONS
CONSENT CALENDAR
President Reed introduced Resolutions
No. 128 through 130 and the Clerk was
instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 128
The 30th Anniversary of
Central Reform Congregation
WHEREAS, Central Reform
Congregation started slowly, out of need. A
few bright young St. Louis area couples with
children nearing school age came to realize that
they needed to act if they were to raise them
as Jews. They had no congregational
affiliations and the last nearby synagogue had
followed its congregants out and away from
the city limits. They did not like the idea of
having the City, for many years home to
several dozen Jewish congregations, totally
devoid of a Jewish presence. These couples
wanted a special kind of Jewish home - a
community where they could raise their

children, sing and dance and pray together.
They were looking for a community that was
inclusive, gender-neutral, non-patriarchal, and
spiritual; and

WHEREAS, wedding their social
consciousness to their burgeoning Jewish
awareness, they decided, after much soulsearching, to create a new Jewish place of
worship within the City of St. Louis. The
group held services in a park during the
summer of 1984 to get people interested about
the new community. Central Reform
Congregation was founded in 1984, with 30
families attending their first High Holiday
services. The founding families chose the name
“Central Reform Congregation” because they
wanted the community to be both “central”
in City location and “Central” in their lives.
In 1985, CRC joined the Reform movement
by joining the UAHC (now the URJ, Union
for Reform Judaism); and

WHEREAS, Rabbi Susan Talve
consulted with the founding families in 1984,
as they determined what kind of community
they wanted to create. In 1985, she was hired
as a part-time rabbi for the congregation.
Today, she serves the community as their
Senior Rabbi. Rabbi Randy Fleisher was hired
in 2000 to help meet the spiritual needs of
their growing community. And in 2008, Rabbi
Ed Harris, one of the founding members and
leaders for many years, was ordained as a
rabbi. Rabbi Ed continued to work as a private
practice psychologist and served part-time as
a rabbi at CRC; and

WHEREAS, thirty years later, believing
more than ever that a desire to heal and
transform the world demands that they not
flee the problems of the inner city, they revel
in their status as the City’s only Jewish
congregation. Their voice is heard in
discussions and plans for urban revitalization
and their hands are busy in a variety of efforts
aimed at revitalizing the area and improving
life for neighbors; and

WHEREAS, with the inspiration and
insightful teaching of Rabbi Susan Talve, Rabbi
Randy Fleisher, and Rabbi Ed Harris, and their
new Rabbi Deana Sussman, as well as the deep
commitment of lay leaders and members, they
have created a vital faith community that looks
for holy responses to all their life situations.
People who never knew what holiness was
are finding it in connecting with one another,
in worshiping together, in studying Torah
together, and in coming together just to
experience the shelter of peace that we create
together; and

WHEREAS, in 1999, they broke ground

on their building in the Central West End. The
building - which they call Sukkat Shalom, or
“Shelter of Peace,” provides a holy space for
not only CRC programs but also for dozens
of community events throughout the year.
Each year, hundreds of youth and adults
participate in their education programs, and
thousands of individuals worship during the
High Holidays, on Shabbat, and at other
holiday celebrations throughout the year..
With no recruitment effort, membership rolls
grew exponentially, from 10 households in
1984 to approximately 750 households today.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to congratulate Central Reform
Congregation and wish them many more years
of success and we further direct the Clerk of
this Board to spread a copy of this Resolution
across the minutes of these proceedings and
to prepare a commemorative copy to the end
that it may be presented to our honoree at a
time and place deemed appropriate by the
Sponsor.

Board Bill No. 295
Committee Substitute As Amended
An Ordinance repealing Section One,
part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining
to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the
same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision on the same subject matter;
containing severability clause.
WHEREAS, local businesses which seek
to enter into contracts with the City of St.
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with
businesses from other areas because of the
higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;
WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS, by enacting a local
preference law that allows a local firm to match
the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to
encourage and stimulate local business.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF
ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION ONE. Section One, part
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.

SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu
thereof is the following new section.
5.58.040 - Opening of bids.

A. Proposals shall be opened at the time
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the
presence of such bidders as desire to be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.
B. The bids shall not be materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more than one local bidder is within two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder
means a bidder whose principal place of
business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where a majority (51%) of the full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.
C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or any part thereof, but the Board of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.
SECTION THREE. Severability.
The provisions of this section are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can be given effect without the invalid
provision.
Approved: April 29, 2013
The right to reject any and all bids is
reserved
