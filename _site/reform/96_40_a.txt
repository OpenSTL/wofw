           OF RESOLUTIONS

       Celebrate Education Day                     
      WHEREAS, childhood illiteracy has            
become an increasing concern, and it is widely     
known that addressing childhood literacy           
issues is one of the most effective methods of     
increasing the likelihood of success of a child    
and in turn improving the neighborhood they        
live in; and                                       
     WHEREAS, unfortunately, children in           
 the St. Louis area continue to fall below the       
 national averages for literacy in their respective  
 age groups; and                                     
       WHEREAS, most of the educators in             
 the city of St. Louis are tireless and dedicated    
 advocates of the children of St. Louis, yet         
 face many challenges outside of the classroom       
 in getting children to succeed at the level they    
 can; and                                            
       WHEREAS, addressing childhood                 
 literacy is not only the responsibility of the      
 school system, but also requires the support        
 of the community at large; and                      
       WHEREAS, the St. Louis Business               
 Resource Center is sponsoring Celebrate             
 Education on January 27, 2013, which is an          
 event to honor the dedication and service of        
 educators in our community, and bring local         
 businesses and educators together to discuss        
 the issue of child literacy; and                    
       WHEREAS, January is National Book             
 Blitz Month, a month-long campaign designed         
 to promote reading; and                             
       WHEREAS, many children in the St.             
 Louis area do not have the proper reading           
 material at home to enable them to enhance          
 their literacy rate; and                            
       WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen                
 encourages local businesses and citizens to         
 use the month of January to actively                
 participate in the challenge and resulting          
 rewards of increasing childhood literacy in the     
 city of St. Louis by donating age appropriate       
 books to be made available to our local             
 students;                                           
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT

       Bidders are hereby advised that the St.      
 Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and             
 associated Regulations could apply to the          
 service for which bids are being sought herein.    
 This Ordinance requires that, unless specific      
 exemptions apply, all individuals who perform      
 work pursuant to a contract executed between       
 the successful bidder and the City must be         
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage       
 rates and if rates are adjusted during the term    
 of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,         
 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.    
 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
 Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration          
 with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration   
 with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.  
 A successful bidder's failure to comply with       
 the contract provisions related to the Living      
 Wage Ordinance may result in termination of      
 the contract and the imposition of additional    
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and        
 Regulations.                                     
       Copies of the Ordinance and Regulations    
 are available upon request from Carol Shepard,   
 at 314-444-5608 or can be accessed at            
 http://www.stlouiscity.com/livingwage.           
      Bidders are also advised that the State     
 of Missouri requires workers on all public       
 works projects to be paid prevailing wages.      
 The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the     
 contracting public body of $100 per day (or      
 portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than  
 the prevailing rate for any work done under      
 the contract by the contractor or by any

             Board Bill No. 295                   
    Committee Substitute As Amended               
      An Ordinance repealing Section One,         
part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining        
to the opening of bids, codified as Section       
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of       
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the    
same subject matter which allows a local bidder   
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid       
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new        
provision on the same subject matter;             
containing severability clause.                   
      WHEREAS, local businesses which seek        
to enter into contracts with the City of St.      
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with      
businesses from other areas because of the        
higher administrative costs of doing business     
in the City;                                      
     WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis               
desires to encourage businesses to remain in      
the City and to relocate to the City;             
      WHEREAS, by enacting a local                
preference law that allows a local firm to match  
the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%          
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to      
encourage and stimulate local business.           
     BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF                
ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                             
     SECTION ONE. Section One, part               
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.        
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                  
 thereof is the following new section.              
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                   
       A. Proposals shall be opened at the time     
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the       
 presence of such bidders as desire to be           
 present, and shall be open to the inspection       
 of bidders.                                        
       B. The bids shall not be materially          
 modified or amended as to price, specification     
 or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,    
 after opening except when the lowest bid is        
 from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid       
 is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder       
 within two percent of the lowest bid may           
 match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches    
 the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner       
 may select the bid from the local bidder. If       
 more than one local bidder is within two           
 percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest    
 local bidder may match the bid. In all other       
 circumstances, modification, supplementation       
 or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.     
 For purposes of this chapter, local bidder         
 means a bidder whose principal place of            
 business is within the City of St. Louis, has      
 had a valid business license for at least one      
 year, and is current in payment of local taxes.    
 Principal place of business shall be defined as    
 the business's physical office, plant, or site     
 where a majority (51%) of the full-time            
 employees, chief officer, and managers of the      
 business regularly work and conduct business,      
 or where the plant or office and equipment         
 required for the furnishing of the goods or        
 performance of the services provided to the        
 City, as required by the contract, are physically  
 located in the City of St. Louis for at least one  
 taxable year immediately prior to the date of      
 the bid.                                           
       C. Bids may be for one or more or all the    
 articles advertised for, but there shall be a      
 specific bid on each article. The award may be     
 made to the lowest bidder for any article, or      
 to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition    
 or any part thereof, but the Board of              
 Standardization may reject any or all bids or      
 any part of any bid.                               
      SECTION THREE. Severability.                  
       The provisions of this section are           
 severable. If any provision of this ordinance      
 is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not     
 affect other provisions of the ordinance which     
 can be given effect without the invalid            
 provision.                                         
 Approved: April 29, 2013                           
      The right to reject any and all bids is
 reserved
