COURTESY RESOLUTIONS
CONSENT CALENDAR
President Reed introduced Resolutions
No. 53 through 71 and No. 73 through 74 and
the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution Number 53
Bertha Gilkey-Bonds
WHEREAS, we pause to express our
sadness and offer condolences to the family
of our long-time friend and community
organizer, Bertha Gilkey-Bonds, who was
called to her reward on May 24, 2014; and

WHEREAS, Bertha Knox Gilkey was
born in Arkansas on March 18th, 1948, to
Willie and Irma Robinson; she moved to St.
Louis in her early teens and was living with
her mother in Cochran Gardens, a public
housing complex, near downtown; and
WHEREAS, by 1969 she was active
with tenants in a rent strike to improve
conditions at the embattled housing complex,

which was part of a city-wide group
protesting issues at the St. Louis Housing
Authority; and
WHEREAS, Bertha was so passionate
about improving the living conditions of
residents of public housing and low income
families that she served on a citywide Tenant
Affairs Board and was elected to head the
Cochran Tenant Management Organization
after being instrumental in persuading the city
of St. Louis to move it to a tenant management
model in 1976; and
WHEREAS, Bertha Gilkey was always
committed to the idea that just because people
are low- income that did not mean they should
not have the same level of services that people
with money had, so she organized the
community to make history reforming public
housing in St. Louis and across the nation;
and
WHEREAS, the Cochran Tenant
Management Corporation became the first of
its kind in St. Louis. In a short time the new
management rehabilitated Cochran Gardens
into a relatively safe and comfortable place.
Since 1978 the complex was modernized and
outfitted with new engineering systems, owing
both to Gilkey’s fundraising skills and to
Cochran’s nearly downtown location that
could not be ignored by city and federal
authorities. By 1992 Cochran received $33
million in federal aid, twice as much as the
second-ranking St. Louis housing complex; and
WHEREAS, Gilkey was the subject of
a 1993 NBC show Fired Up! The Bertha
Gilkey Story produced by John Singleton and
President George H. W. Bush visited Cochran
Gardens in May 1991, commending tenant
management and Betha Gilkey as a leader; and
WHEREAS, in addition to all her
accomplishments, recognitions, and awards,
Bertha was also a devoted mother to her two
children, Antoine and Yvette, who shared her
with the citizens of St. Louis or anywhere she
was needed to fight the good fight.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOVED by the Board of Aldermen of the
City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the great work and
activism of Bertha Gilkey-Bonds and offer
our condolences at her passing. We further
direct the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy
of this Resolution across the minutes of these
proceedings and to prepare a memorial copy
for presentation to the family of Bertha
Gilkey at a time and place deemed appropriate
by the Sponsor.

is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision on the same subject matter;

after opening except when the lowest bid is

is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may

match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner

more than one local bidder is within two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be

to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or any part thereof, but the Board of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.

can be given effect without the invalid
provision.
