COURTESY RESOLUTIONS
CONSENT CALENDAR

President Reed introduced Resolutions
No. 131 through 141 and the Clerk was
instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 131

PLEASANT GROVE CHURCH
(CHURCH OF KOINONIA)
WHEREAS, Pleasant Grove Church
was founded in 1914 under the leadership of
the late Rev. Dan Davis, however, the church
was known at the time as Mt. Moriah. The
church relocated several times throughout its
colorful history and moved to 19th Street and
was renamed Nineteenth Street Baptist
Church; and

WHEREAS, in 1937, Rev. Daniel C.
Davis was called to the pastorate by the
faithful group of Mother Alice Edmondson,
Sister Viola Blevins McIntyre, Brother Louis
McIntyre, Brother Harry McIntyre, Sister
Reola McIntyre, Deacon Jeff McMillan, Sister
Hattie McMillan, Deacon Ben Sample,
Mother Elizabeth Sample, sister Mattie
Moore, Deacon Thomas Tate, Deacon Henry
Thomas, Sister Laura Wilson, and Sister Anna
Houston. The church moved several times,
to include the 20th Street location (between
O’Fallon and Cass) and onto 23rd Street and
finally O’Fallon Avenue; and

WHEREAS, subsequently plans were
drawn for remodeling and the name was
changed from Nineteenth Street Baptist
Church to Pleasant Grove Missionary Baptist
Church. On the first Sunday in January, 1954,
the church moved to 2407 Belle Glade. The
church soon saw the need for a better building
and plans began to build a new church. Three
houses north of the church building were
purchased and demolished. It is on these lots
that our first edifice stands at 2411 Belle Glade
Avenue (currently known as the Hildred
London Multipurpose Room). The pioneer
leader Rev. Daniel C. Davis retired after 45

years of Pastoral Leadership and the church
elected Rev. Spencer Wilford to serve as pastor
from 1983-1987, Rev. Spencer Wilford’s
ecclesiastical investment was a bridge that led
this congregation through a time of transition
and restructuring. In December of 1988, the
congregation elected Rev. Courtney A. Jones
(now elevated to the office of Bishop) pastor
of “the Grove”; and
WHEREAS, since then, the fellowship
has enjoyed an abundance of blessings from
the Lord. Bishop Jones has helped to
successfully navigate this ministry and its
congregants to grow by leaps and bounds,
spiritually, physically and fiscally. His
influence with other pastors and political
leaders has addressed many of the issues facing
our communities internationally, nationally
and locally. Bishop Jones, a visionary of God,
became a voice of revitalization in this, the
Greater Ville neighborhood, rebuilding its
cosmetic face. New housing and renovation
began to occur in this historic area, reviving
its great legacy; and
WHEREAS, in 2002, the Pleasant
Grove Missionary Baptist Church was
renamed Pleasant Grove Church (The Church
of Koinonia). God led Pastor Jones (at this
stage of his ministry work) to the Full Gospel
Baptist Church Fellowship with Bishop Paul
S. Morton as presiding Bishop. On June 26,
2007, the Pleasant Grove Church celebrated
as their Pastor was consecrated Bishop of the
State of Missouri at the FGBCF International
Conference in Atlanta, Georgia.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize Pleasant Grove
Missionary Baptist Church and we wish
continued success, achievement and
accomplishment and we further direct the
Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of this
Resolution across the minutes of these
proceedings and to prepare a commemorative
copy to the end that it may be presented to
our honoree at a time and place deemed

to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of

same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision on the same subject matter;

desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS, by enacting a local
preference law that allows a local firm to match

SECTION ONE. Section One, part

or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may

employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment

City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be

Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.
