Resolution No. 62
Breaking Through
WHEREAS, in the film Breaking
Through, openly LGBT elected officials at all
levels - including the first gay US Senator,
Tammy Baldwin - share their stories of selfdoubt and triumph over multiple barriers
ranging from race and poverty to gender and
sexual orientation, revealing a deeply personal,
rarely-seen side of politicians and gay people;
and

WHEREAS, though featuring
politicians, it isn’t about politics: it’s about
people who feel fear and shame, yearning to
live meaningful lives; and
WHEREAS, they reveal with surprising
vulnerability how they broke through internal
and external barriers to achieve the future they
envisioned. By showing that “anything is
possible,” they impact those from any walk
of life who are struggling and seek to prevent
them from taking their own lives or living in
repressed, depressed conditions; and
WHEREAS, Cindy L. Abel formed
Atlantis Moon Productions in 2007 to
develop film-related projects that launch
conversations and impact popular culture. Her
first full-length documentary, the awardwinning film Breaking Through, was conceived
in response to the high number of teens who
were taunted because of being gay or perceived
to be and committing suicide. Having struggled
with coming out, Abel knew the importance
of having positive role models and wanted to
highlight openly LGBT leaders living
authentic and fulfilled lives.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the film Breaking
Through and we further direct the Clerk of
this Board to spread a copy of this Resolution
