       Bidders are hereby advised that the St.    
 Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and

 This Ordinance requires that, unless specific    
 exemptions apply, all individuals who perform    
 work pursuant to a contract executed between     
 the successful bidder and the City must be       
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage     
 rates and if rates are adjusted during the term  
 of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,       
 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.  
 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage         
 Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration        
 with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration 
 with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.
 A successful bidder's failure to comply with     
 the contract provisions related to the Living    
 Wage Ordinance may result in termination of      
 the contract and the imposition of additional    
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and        
 Regulations.

 works projects to be paid prevailing wages.      
 The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the     
 contracting public body of $100 per day (or      
 portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than  
 the prevailing rate for any work done under      
 the contract by the contractor or by any

           employee, the living wage rate is      
           $12.21 per hour (130% of the federal   
           poverty level income guideline for a   
           family of three); and                  
    2)     Where health benefits as defined in

           the employee, the living wage rate is  
           $15.92 per hour (130% of the federal   
          poverty level income guideline for a    
          family of three, plus fringe benefit

of the City of St. Louis.
