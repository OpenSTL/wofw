           Resolution No. 174                    
      Mr. Damon Dwight Lovett Jr.                
       WHEREAS, Mr. Damon Dwight Lovett          
 Jr. was born on August 4, 1997 in Saint Louis,  
 Missouri to Shayla Verges and Damon Lovett.     
 Damon walked into the loving arms of GOD        
 Wednesday, November 19, 2014, at the age of     
 seventeen. Damon was preceded in death by       
 his paternal grandmother, the late Carolyn      
 Smith; great grandmother, the late Yvonne       
 Sharpe; and his best friend and cousin, Ryan    
 James Thurman; and                              
      WHEREAS, Damon had the wonderful           
 experience of living in Orlando, Florida for    
 two years, 2008 to 2010. He also had the        
 privilege to attend an accelerated Middle       
 School in which Tiger Woods' children also      
 attended. Damon selected the trumpet as his     
 extra curriculum activity along with skate      
 boarding, swimming and hanging out with his     
 new diverse group of friends. One friend in     
 particular, Rico Goss, took Damon in as an       
 older brother; and                               
       WHEREAS, Damon found a new                 
 passion for videogames and programming,          
 which he played intensely with his Uncle Chris   
 on a weekend basis. Damon was also an avid       
 lover of sports, although he never physically    
 played any. He attended Gateway High School      
 from 2012 to 2013, where he was an Air Force     
 Cadet in ROTC before transferring to             
 Northwest High School and Beaumont High          
 School. From 2013 to 2014, Damon dedicated       
 his life to the culinary arts and cooking        
 gourmet dishes for his family to enjoy; and      
       WHEREAS, Damon will be greatly             
 missed by everyone that knew him. He was         
 the kind of young man that anyone would be       
 proud to call their son, grandson and friend.    
 Damon had a sarcasm and wit that was             
 undeniable. He could make you cry, laugh         
 and mad with his joking and debates on topics    
 that stretched far and wide. Damon was truly     
 the Brains of the operation, and Kayla was       
 his Pinky; and                                   
      WHEREAS, Damon is survived by: his          
 parents, Shayla Verges and stepfathers, Lavan    
 Goods and Benjamin Randle; two little sisters,   
 Kayla Miller and Kelsey Randle; great aunt,      
 Paula Anderson, and great uncle Mark (Freda)     
 Thurman; aunts, Danielle Kennedy and Tasha       
 Lovett; uncles, Grayling Smith Jr., Christopher  
 Smith, Aaron Verges, Stephon Verges and          
 Demetrius Lovett; cousins, Tanera Curtis-        
 Allen, Tanisha Ballard, Mark Thurman Jr.,        
 Mia Thurman and D'Angelo Monroe; along           
 with numerous extended cousins and friends.      
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of             
 the City of St. Louis that we pause to

 the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of

           Raoul Holman, Sr.                      
     WHEREAS, Raoul Holman, Sr.                   
affectionately known as "Ray", was born on        
December 27, 1935 in St. Louis, Mo to the         
union of Albert I. and Aileen (Dorsey)            
 Holman. Ray was the eldest of five children.     
 Ray's wife, Norma J. Holman and his father       
 preceded him in death; and                       
       WHEREAS, Ray attended St. Louis            
 Public Schools and later graduated from          
 Sumner High School in 1954. He met the love      
 of his life, Norma Jean (Howard) and they        
 were married on September 23, 1956. To this      
 union, three sons were born, Raoul Holman,       
 Jr., Kevin A. Holman, and Andre' Holman.         
 Ray and Norma were married for fifty-seven       
 wonderful years; and                             
      WHEREAS, Ray confessed his hope in          
 Christ at an early age and was baptized at

 under the late Reverend George H. Pruitt; and    
       WHEREAS, Ray worked various job            
 capacities early in his life. On February 14,    
 1966, Ray became one of the first African-

 Edward Jones Dome. After 32 years in             
 construction work, working as a journeyman       
 pipe fitter and welder, he earned the right to   
 retire on February 14, 1998. Ray's true          
 passion was remolding his home for Norma         
 and the kids, from extending the kitchen, the    
 bedroom, family room to building a play house

 all of the many activities in which their boys   
 participated. They would travel to many cities   
 to support their sons as well as supporting      
 and encouraging their teammates and friends      
 as well. Raoul and Norman were strong            
 supporters of the Royal Knights organization,    
 Northwest High School, Southwest High            
 School and Sumner High School following their    
 sons in all their endeavors. They continued      
 their support of their sons as coaches at the    
 Herbert Hoover Boys Club. Raoul and              
 Norman cheered their children and grand-         
 children as the years went by; and               
       WHEREAS, Ray and Norma had a love          
 for entertaining. Ray and Norma were a joy       
 to all that came in contact with them. Ray       
 enjoyed hosting parties for Super Bowl           
 Sunday. His favorite all time team was the       
 Dallas Cowboys. He enjoyed going to the          
 Kappa House for Jazz events with his love        
 Norma; and                                       
      WHEREAS, Ray went on to be with             
 the Lord and his darling wife, a day after he    
 and Norma would have celebrated their fifty-     
 eight wedding anniversary on Wednesday,          
 September 24, 2014; and

 The 175th Anniversary of Centenary               
        United Methodist Church                   
      WHEREAS, we are delighted to pause          
in our deliberations to recognize the members,    
present and past, of the Centenary United         
Methodist Church on the occasion of their         
175th Anniversary; and                            
      WHEREAS, the Centenary United               
Methodist Church has been providing               
ministry to the downtown and metropolitan         
St. Louis since 1839. Initially, the church was   
funded by the hard work of the ladies             
"society", and therefore was known as the         
"Ladies Church"; and                              
      WHEREAS, when many congregations            
were moving out west, Centenary made the          
decision to stay in its downtown location on      
December 31st, 1900, allowing the church to       
serve thousands of servicemen during World        
War II due to its close proximity to Union        
Station; and                                      
     WHEREAS, in the 1990's, Centenary            
made a commitment to welcome all people           
regardless of race, ethnicity, marital status,    
age or sexual orientation, making it the first    
Reconciling Congregation of the United            
Methodist Church in St. Louis; and                
      WHEREAS, today's mission statement          
is: "Centenary United Methodist Church is a       
church of neighbors, committed to serving all     
people whom God has placed in our midst           
through our caring presence and mindful           
actions as demonstrated in the life of Jesus";    
and                                               
       WHEREAS, through 175 years,                
 Centenary has been instrumental in starting      
 new Methodist congregations, new service         
 agencies, and assisting individuals who are      
 called to the ministry, including three pastors  
 who became Bishops in the Methodist church;      
 for many years, the building housed the offices

      WHEREAS, we pause to express our            
 sadness and offer condolences to the family      
 of long-time judge, the Honorable Michael        
 Calvin; and                                      
       WHEREAS, Michael Byron Calvin was          
 born February 16, 1951, in Nashville,            
 Tennessee, the oldest of Lincoln Byron Calvin    
 Sr. and Thelma Vashti Satterwhite's three        
 children. His father was a pediatric             
 psychiatrist and his mother was a special        
 education teacher. The family moved to St.       
 Louis when he was 2, and he grew up on the       
 city's north side near Natural Bridge Road       
 and Kingshighway; and                            
       WHEREAS, he graduated from                 
 Beaumont High School in 1968, and                
 throughout the years, he volunteered with the    
 school's truancy program. In 1972, he            
 graduated from Monmouth College in Illinois      
 with a Bachelor of Arts in history and           
 government. He earned his law degree from        
 Saint Louis University School of Law in 1975;    
 and                                              
     WHEREAS, Judge Calvin received the           
 Mound City Bar Association Distinguished         
 Legal Service Award and was honored by the       
 National College of State Judiciary and the      
 Missouri Judicial College. He was assigned to    
 the Supreme Court of Missouri three times        
 and served as the attorney for the St. Louis     
 Board of Election Commissioners for three        
 years; and                                       
       WHEREAS, after he left the bench in        
 2008, he was of counsel with Spencer Fane        
 Britt & Browne, where he had a focus on          
 mediation and arbitration. He also was a         
 member of the 22nd Circuit Judicial              
 Commission, which selects nominees to send       
 to the governor for city court bench vacancies;  
 and                                              
       WHEREAS, one of the inveterate chess       
 player's best moves came when he met             
 Vanessa Gardner at one of his favorite places:   
 a golf course. She was grateful when he offered  
 to advise her about a recent speeding ticket.    
 Not coincidentally, the information she shared   
 also enabled him to contact her later for a date.
 They were married in 1987; and                   
       WHEREAS, in addition to his wife and       
 daughter, the man who after 5 p.m. insisted      
 upon being called just plain `Mike' (that's      
 `Uncle Mike' for family) is survived by two      
 sons, Michael (Leila) Calvin and Justin Calvin,  
 both of Florissant; a brother, Lincoln (Karynn)  
 Calvin and a sister Robin (Kyle) Rutlin, both    
 of St. Louis.                                    
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of             
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

 this Board to spread a copy of this Resolution   
 across the minutes of these proceedings and

       An Ordinance repealing Section One,       
 part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining      
 to the opening of bids, codified as Section     
 5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of     
 St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the  
 same subject matter which allows a local bidder 
 to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid     
 is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new      
 provision on the same subject matter;           
 containing severability clause.                 
       WHEREAS, local businesses which seek      
 to enter into contracts with the City of St.    
 Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with    
 businesses from other areas because of the      
 higher administrative costs of doing business   
 in the City;                                    
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis             
 desires to encourage businesses to remain in    
 the City and to relocate to the City;           
       WHEREAS, by enacting a local              
 preference law that allows a local firm to match
 the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%        
 percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to    
 encourage and stimulate local business.         
      BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF              
 ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                           
      SECTION ONE. Section One, part             
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.     
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu               
 thereof is the following new section.           
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                
      A. Proposals shall be opened at the time   
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the    
 presence of such bidders as desire to be        
present, and shall be open to the inspection     
of bidders.                                      
      B. The bids shall not be materially        
modified or amended as to price, specification   
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,  
after opening except when the lowest bid is      
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid     
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder     
within two percent of the lowest bid may         
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches  
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner     
may select the bid from the local bidder. If     
more than one local bidder is within two         
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest  
local bidder may match the bid. In all other     
circumstances, modification, supplementation     
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.   
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder       
means a bidder whose principal place of          
business is within the City of St. Louis, has    
had a valid business license for at least one    
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.  
Principal place of business shall be defined as  
the business's physical office, plant, or site   
where a majority (51%) of the full-time          
employees, chief officer, and managers of the    
business regularly work and conduct business,    
or where the plant or office and equipment       
required for the furnishing of the goods or      
performance of the services provided to the      
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of    
the bid.                                         
      C. Bids may be for one or more or all the  
articles advertised for, but there shall be a    
specific bid on each article. The award may be   
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or    
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition  
or any part thereof, but the Board of            
Standardization may reject any or all bids or    
any part of any bid.                             
     SECTION THREE. Severability.                
      The provisions of this section are         
severable. If any provision of this ordinance    
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not   
affect other provisions of the ordinance which   
can be given effect without the invalid          
provision.                                       
Approved: April 29, 2013                         
     The right to reject any and all bids is     
reserved
