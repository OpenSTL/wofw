    Committee Substitute As Amended               
      An Ordinance repealing Section One,         
part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining        
to the opening of bids, codified as Section       
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of       
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the    
same subject matter which allows a local bidder   
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid       
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new        
provision on the same subject matter;             
containing severability clause.                   
      WHEREAS, local businesses which seek        
to enter into contracts with the City of St.      
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with      
businesses from other areas because of the        
higher administrative costs of doing business     
in the City;                                      
     WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis               
desires to encourage businesses to remain in      
the City and to relocate to the City;             
      WHEREAS, by enacting a local                
preference law that allows a local firm to match  
the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%          
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to      
encourage and stimulate local business.           
     BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF                
ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                             
     SECTION ONE. Section One, part               
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.       
     SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                 
thereof is the following new section.             
     5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                  
      A. Proposals shall be opened at the time    
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the      
presence of such bidders as desire to be          
present, and shall be open to the inspection      
of bidders.                                       
      B. The bids shall not be materially         
modified or amended as to price, specification    
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,   
 after opening except when the lowest bid is      
 from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid     
 is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder     
 within two percent of the lowest bid may         
 match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches  
 the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner     
 may select the bid from the local bidder. If     
 more than one local bidder is within two         
 percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest  
 local bidder may match the bid. In all other     
 circumstances, modification, supplementation     
 or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.   
 For purposes of this chapter, local bidder       
 means a bidder whose principal place of          
 business is within the City of St. Louis, has    
 had a valid business license for at least one    
 year, and is current in payment of local taxes.  
 Principal place of business shall be defined as  
 the business's physical office, plant, or site   
 where a majority (51%) of the full-time          
 employees, chief officer, and managers of the    
 business regularly work and conduct business,    
 or where the plant or office and equipment       
 required for the furnishing of the goods or      
 performance of the services provided to the      
 City, as required by the contract, are physically
 located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
 taxable year immediately prior to the date of    
 the bid.                                         
       C. Bids may be for one or more or all the  
 articles advertised for, but there shall be a    
 specific bid on each article. The award may be   
 made to the lowest bidder for any article, or    
 to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition  
 or any part thereof, but the Board of            
 Standardization may reject any or all bids or    
 any part of any bid.                             
      SECTION THREE. Severability.                
       The provisions of this section are         
 severable. If any provision of this ordinance

 provision.
