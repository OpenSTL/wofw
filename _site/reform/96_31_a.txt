            Resolution No. 133                     
    SEA 30th Reunion Class of `83                  
       WHEREAS, St. Elizabeth Academy,             
 located at 3401 Arsenal Street opened in 1882     
 as an all girl Catholic High School; and          
       WHEREAS, in the Fall of 1979 a young        
 class of bright women arrived, ready for new      
 experiences; new people to meet, new              
 uniforms, no boys, new teachers, a schedule       
 with "mods" that seemed like a puzzle, new        
 things to do; and                                 
        WHEREAS, the Class of '83 soon felt        
 at home and very comfortable at SEA. The          
 young freshmen women made their first high        
 school retreat, held at the St. Mary's Sisters    
 Motherhouse, where they learned much about        
 themselves and bonded tremendously with           
 their classmates. Their enthusiasm carried over   
 into Spirit Week as the girls showed lots of      
 energy and they truly were "hopping with          
 spirit." and                                      
       WHEREAS, in 1981 this young class           
 came back as sophomores, with a confidence        
 that could not be mistaken. The bonds had         
 formed, and friendships that would last 30        
 years had only just begun. That year, the entire  
 school knew the sophomores meant business,        
 when they won the Annual Penny Walk. More         
 connections were made as their journey            
 continued that November during their retreat      
 to Mercy; and                                     
       WHEREAS, in 1982 St. Elizabeth              
 Academy celebrated its 100th anniversary          
 with a city-wide Centennial celebration and       
 parade. Mayor Vince Schomehl proclaimed           
 Sept 1st Centennial Day and Tennessee Street      
 became St. Elizabeth Avenue. The Class of         
 '83 represented the school with a cookie          
 monster float and one of our own leading the      
 parade carrying the school flag. By this time,    
 lifelong friendships had been formed and          
 families had been joined together as the Class    
 of '83 moved closer towards senior year and       
 graduation; and                                   
        WHEREAS, 1982 had finally arrived          
 and so had the Class of 1983. Four years          
 later, we received our rings; special to our class
symbolizing our ties with St. Elizabeth           
Academy, with our classmates, with the            
future. We were now the Big Sisters, Snoopy       
was our mascot, the pink rose was our flower,     
and "The Times of Our Lives" had just begun.      
After hundreds of classes, tons of laughter, a    
few trips to the principal's office, this was a   
special year. The book was closed on our          
Centennial celebrations and we are the first      
graduates of the new century. (Not to mention     
our St. Louis Cardinals went all the way won      
the World Series right here in town and as        
seniors we won for Spirit Week with Snoopy        
at bat).                                          
     NOW THEREFORE BE IT                          
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of              
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our        
deliberations to recognize the Class of 1983      
on the occasion of their 30th High School         
Reunion and wish them well as they celebrate      
with Mass and a social gathering at Bartolino's.  
We further direct the Clerk of this Board to      
spread a copy of this Resolution across the       
minutes of these proceedings and to prepare a     
commemorative copy to the end that it may

 Honorable Donna Baringer,Alderwoman 16thWard   
           Resolution No. 135                   
     The 40th Anniversary of the                
  Metropolitan Community Church                 
          of Greater Saint Louis                
       WHEREAS, Metropolitan Community          
 Church of Greater Saint Louis began in         
 October 1973. Their first worship service was  
 held at the Berea Presbyterian Church at 3010  
 Olive Street. This October 28th worship        
 service was attended by about a dozen people   
 and was affiliated with the Universal          
 Fellowship of Metropolitan Community           
 Churches (MCC). They received our MCC          
 charter in April 21, 1974. At the time, MCC    
 had about sixty congregations or missions. St. 
 Louis had no organized "homosexual"            
 organization existing at that time; and        
       WHEREAS, by December 23, 1974, the       
 group of about 150 members had purchased a     
 home in the Central West End. The acquisition  
 of the house at 5108 Waterman, according to    
 the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, was believed to   
 "mark the first time in Missouri that any self-
 proclaimed homosexual group has owned its      
 own facilities."; and                          
       WHEREAS, several years later, in 1984,   
 they purchased a beautiful, old church building
 near downtown St. Louis, in the Lafayette      
 area. Constructed in 1870 as St. John's        
 Episcopal Church, the 1120 Dolman building     
 was taken over by the St. Mary's Assumption    
 Ukrainian Rite congregation early in the 20th  
 century; and                                   
       WHEREAS, in the 1990's, they sold the    
 Dolman property because of financial           
 considerations. In 1997, they leased space at  
 the St. John's Methodist Church on             
 Washington Place, in the Central West End.     
 They continued to meet social challenges and   
 church changes. Soon after moving to the       
 rented space we experienced a big growth       
 spurt. They became even more visible in the    
 community and collaborated with many other     
 organizations. In addition to continuing to    
 work with LGBT groups, they began a            
 partnership with a city group called MCU -     
 Metropolitan Congregations United, an          
 interfaith, ecumenical organization dealing    
 with political and social issues in St. Louis  
 city, and beyond; and                          
      WHEREAS, in the 2000s, they began a       
search for a new, permanent home. On January      
1, 2007, they left they rented space on           
Washington Blvd. and (temporarily) moved          
our worship service to a catering hall in         
Soulard. On the day of that move, someone         
noticed a "for sale" sign at their current        
building, just a dozen blocks away, ultimately    
resulting in the acquisition of the property;     
and                                               
     WHEREAS, during this time, they              
became more diverse, increasing African           
American, transgender and straight                
membership, allowing them to do more diverse      
community outreach. They expanded our             
offerings for children and young adult            
programs. They participated in numerous           
community events, with substantial                
involvement in the AIDS Walk, Metropolitan        
Congregations United (MCU) events, St.            
Louis Pride, and Komen Race for the Cure.         
We've supported and worked with groups like       
HRC, Food Outreach, Gateway Men's                 
Chorus, Charis, Band Together and Black           
Pride Festival; and                               
     WHEREAS, most recently, their much-          
celebrated choir won the 2011 Verizon             
Wireless Regional Competition for Gospel          
Choirs called "How Sweet the Sound." In           
2012, our church received recognition from        
Interfaith Power and Light as a "Cool             
Congregation" for our green and sustainability    
programs and projects.                            
     NOW THEREFORE BE IT                          
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of              
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

     Committee Substitute As Amended               
       An Ordinance repealing Section One,         
 part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining        
 to the opening of bids, codified as Section       
 5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of       
 St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the    
 same subject matter which allows a local bidder   
 to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid       
 is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new        
 provision on the same subject matter;             
 containing severability clause.                   
       WHEREAS, local businesses which seek        
 to enter into contracts with the City of St.      
 Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with      
 businesses from other areas because of the        
 higher administrative costs of doing business     
 in the City;                                      
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis               
 desires to encourage businesses to remain in      
 the City and to relocate to the City;             
       WHEREAS, by enacting a local                
 preference law that allows a local firm to match  
 the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%          
 percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to      
 encourage and stimulate local business.          
      BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF               
 ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                            
      SECTION ONE. Section One, part              
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.      
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                
 thereof is the following new section.            
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                 
       A. Proposals shall be opened at the time   
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the     
 presence of such bidders as desire to be         
 present, and shall be open to the inspection     
 of bidders.                                      
       B. The bids shall not be materially        
 modified or amended as to price, specification   
 or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,  
 after opening except when the lowest bid is      
 from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid     
 is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder     
 within two percent of the lowest bid may         
 match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches  
 the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner     
 may select the bid from the local bidder. If     
 more than one local bidder is within two         
 percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest  
 local bidder may match the bid. In all other     
 circumstances, modification, supplementation     
 or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.   
 For purposes of this chapter, local bidder       
 means a bidder whose principal place of          
 business is within the City of St. Louis, has    
 had a valid business license for at least one    
 year, and is current in payment of local taxes.  
 Principal place of business shall be defined as  
 the business's physical office, plant, or site   
 where a majority (51%) of the full-time          
 employees, chief officer, and managers of the    
 business regularly work and conduct business,    
 or where the plant or office and equipment       
 required for the furnishing of the goods or      
 performance of the services provided to the      
 City, as required by the contract, are physically
 located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
 taxable year immediately prior to the date of    
 the bid.                                         
       C. Bids may be for one or more or all the  
 articles advertised for, but there shall be a    
 specific bid on each article. The award may be   
 made to the lowest bidder for any article, or    
 to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition  
 or any part thereof, but the Board of            
 Standardization may reject any or all bids or    
 any part of any bid.                             
      SECTION THREE. Severability.                
      The provisions of this section are          
 severable. If any provision of this ordinance    
 is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not   
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can be given effect without the invalid       
provision.                                    
Approved: April 29, 2013                      
     The right to reject any and all bids is  
reserved
