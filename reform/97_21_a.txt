matters of employment, upgrading, transfer,

      The City of St. Louis reserves the right     
to waive any formalities and to reject any and     
all bids. The SLMPD also reserves the right        
to consider criteria other than the low bid in     
the award of a contract. Among other factors,      
the SLMPD will consider the location of the        
business, minority interest in the business,       
prior performance and the bid submitted in         
relation to the needs of the St. Louis             
Metropolitan Police Department.                    
      Bidders are hereby advised that the St.      
Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and             
associated Regulations could apply to the          
service for which bids are being sought herein.    
This Ordinance requires that, unless specific      
exemptions apply, all individuals who perform      
work pursuant to a contract executed between       
the successful bidder and the City must be         
paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage       
rates and if rates are adjusted during the term    
of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,         
applicable rates after such adjustment is made.    
Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration          
with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration   
with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.  
A successful bidder's failure to comply with       
 the contract provisions related to the Living    
 Wage Ordinance may result in termination of      
 the contract and the imposition of additional    
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and        
 Regulations.                                     
       Copies of the Ordinance and Regulations    
 are available upon request from Carol Shepard,   
 at 314-444-5608 or can be accessed at            
 http://www.stlouiscity.com/livingwage.           
      Bidders are also advised that the State     
 of Missouri requires workers on all public       
 works projects to be paid prevailing wages.      
 The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the     
 contracting public body of $100 per day (or      
 portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than  
 the prevailing rate for any work done under      
 the contract by the contractor or by any         
 subcontractor (Section 290.250, RSMo.).          
 Also, if a vendor would like to receive a bid    
 please email a request to bnturner@slmpd.org.

LIVING WAGE ADJUSTMENT BULLETIN                   
         NOTICE OF ST. LOUIS                      
          LIVING WAGE RATES                       
        EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2014                   
In accordance with Ordinance No. 65597, the       
St. Louis Living Wage Ordinance                   
("Ordinance") and the Regulations associated      
therewith, the City Compliance Official for       
the City of St. Louis has determined that the     
following living wage rates are now in effect     
for employees of covered contracts:               
   1)    Where health benefits as defined in      
         the Ordinance are provided to the        
         employee, the living wage rate is        
         $12.37 per hour (130% of the federal     
         poverty level income guideline for a     
         family of three); and                    
   2)    Where health benefits as defined in      
         the Ordinance are not provided to        
         the employee, the living wage rate is    
         $16.18 per hour (130% of the federal     
         poverty level income guideline for a     
         family of three, plus fringe benefit     
         rates as defined in the Ordinance).      
   3)    Wages required under Chapter 6.20        
         of the Revised Code of the City of       
         St. Louis: $3.81 per hour.               
These rates are based upon federal poverty        
level income guidelines as defined in the         
Ordinance and these rates are effective as of     
April 1, 2014. These rates will be further

level income guideline is adjusted by the U.S.    
Department of Health and Human Services or        
pursuant to Chapter 6.20 of the Revised Code      
of the City of St. Louis.                         
The Ordinance applies to employers who are        
covered by the Ordinance as defined in the        
Ordinance, where the contract or grant is         
 entered into or renewed after the effective date

      An Ordinance repealing Section One,         
part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining        
to the opening of bids, codified as Section       
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of       
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the    
same subject matter which allows a local bidder   
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid       
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new        
provision on the same subject matter;             
containing severability clause.                   
      WHEREAS, local businesses which seek        
to enter into contracts with the City of St.      
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with      
businesses from other areas because of the        
higher administrative costs of doing business     
in the City;                                      
     WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis               
desires to encourage businesses to remain in      
the City and to relocate to the City;             
      WHEREAS, by enacting a local                
preference law that allows a local firm to match  
the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%          
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to      
encourage and stimulate local business.           
     BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF                
ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                             
     SECTION ONE. Section One, part               
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.       
     SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                 
thereof is the following new section.             
     5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                  
      A. Proposals shall be opened at the time    
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the      
presence of such bidders as desire to be          
present, and shall be open to the inspection      
of bidders.                                       
      B. The bids shall not be materially         
modified or amended as to price, specification    
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,   
after opening except when the lowest bid is       
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid      
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder      
within two percent of the lowest bid may          
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches   
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner      
may select the bid from the local bidder. If      
more than one local bidder is within two          
 percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest  
 local bidder may match the bid. In all other     
 circumstances, modification, supplementation     
 or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.

 means a bidder whose principal place of          
 business is within the City of St. Louis, has    
 had a valid business license for at least one    
 year, and is current in payment of local taxes.  
 Principal place of business shall be defined as  
 the business's physical office, plant, or site   
 where a majority (51%) of the full-time          
 employees, chief officer, and managers of the    
 business regularly work and conduct business,    
 or where the plant or office and equipment       
 required for the furnishing of the goods or      
 performance of the services provided to the      
 City, as required by the contract, are physically
 located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
 taxable year immediately prior to the date of    
 the bid.                                         
       C. Bids may be for one or more or all the  
 articles advertised for, but there shall be a    
 specific bid on each article. The award may be   
 made to the lowest bidder for any article, or    
 to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition  
 or any part thereof, but the Board of            
 Standardization may reject any or all bids or    
 any part of any bid.

       The provisions of this section are         
 severable. If any provision of this ordinance

 provision.
