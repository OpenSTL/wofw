residents about cats in need. The Animal
House shelter provides a safe environment
and medical care for the abandoned and

House come to the shelter from challenging
circumstances that include neglect,

abandonment and illness. Despite their sad
histories, they are each provided with
nutritious food, medical care, socialization,
individual attention, love and the very best
effort to find each a loving and forever home;
and
WHEREAS, the Animal House facility
is large, airy, inviting and to the delight of
their residents, exclusive to felines. Most
days, there are at least 200 happy, healthy
cats and kittens in the building, waiting to be
adopted; and
WHEREAS, in 2013 Animal House has
successfully adopted nearly 100 cats to loving
families. They do so with limited staff and
resources. Their goal for 2014 is to provide
save, loving homes to all their cats and kittens.
As a no-kill facility they offer state of the art
care in an open environment to enhance the
lives of cats and kittens in the city of St. Louis.

FIRST READING OF
RESOLUTIONS

Mr. French introduced Resolution No.
174 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 174

WHEREAS, on October 26, 2013, an
article in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch outlined
serious concerns related to the wrongful arrests
of up to one hundred St. Louis citizens due to
“clerical mistakes, and sloppy” attention to
fingerprint reports; and

WHEREAS, according to the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch article and lawsuits filed by
alleged victims, these fingerprint reports
provided information that the citizen arrested
was the wrong person; and

WHEREAS, in response to The PostDispatch’s claims of identifying 100 people
arrested in error over the past seven years,
who have collectively spent more than 2,000
days in jail, Eddie Roth, a senior aide to Mayor
Francis Slay, is quoted in the article saying, “I
worry about a lot of things. I don’t worry
about this.” ; and

WHEREAS, officials have stated it is
the fault of the individuals wrongfully arrested
because, if their name had not been in a criminal
justice database, the mistake could not have
been made.

WHEREAS, it is the responsibility of
the City of St. Louis and its law enforcement
officials to preserve the civil liberties of all
citizens, regardless of past infractions; and

WHEREAS, there are numerous
concerns raised by these wrongful arrests, as
reported. These concerns include: failure to
verify the identity of the people arrested;
potentially ignoring protests of citizens
wrongfully arrested; failure to differentiate
between the people who gave false names and
the people whose names were being falsely
used as aliases; downplaying cases where
systematic failure caused wrongful arrests of
St. Louis citizens; and failure to correct errors
in records which caused repeated wrongful
arrests, leaving authorities unsure of who they

were holding or who committed which past
crimes; and

WHEREAS, city officials have
questioned the accuracy of the newspaper’s
overall information; and

WHEREAS, wrongful arrests have
negative consequences on the lives of the
citizens wrongfully arrested and erodes the
faith of citizens in our judicial system; and

WHEREAS, it is the duty of St. Louis
Board of Aldermen to work to assure that all
of our constituents have confidence that their
liberties and safety are justly protected.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Alderman for
the City of St. Louis that we direct the Public
Safety Committee to convene hearings for the
purpose of examining and investigating the
events, conditions, circumstances and failures
that lead to the wrongful arrests of citizens of
the City of St. Louis.

Resolution No. 170
Tile and Stone International
1541-45 S. Kingshighway Blvd.
City of St. Louis Enterprise Zone
WHEREAS, by Ordinance No. 62886
this St. Louis Board of Aldermen (the “Board”)
authorized the Mayor, on behalf of the City
of St. Louis (the “City”), to request the
designation of a certain area of the City, as
more fully described in said ordinance
approved June 29, 1993 as an St. Louis
Enterprise Zone (“EZ”) eligible for the tax
incentives provided in Sections 135.100

through 135.255, inclusive, R.S.MO. as
amended (the “Statute”); and

WHEREAS, the Statute allows, in
certain circumstances and subject to certain
conditions, the ad valorem taxes which would
otherwise be due on subsequent real estate
improvements made in EZ areas to be abated
up to 100% for a period not to exceed 25
years from the date the original EZ Area was
so designated; and

WHEREAS, Ordinance No. 62886
provides for a ten (10) year abatement of taxes
on real property in the EZ in accordance with
the requirements of Section 135.215 of the
Statute, as amended from time to time, subject
to certain terms and conditions; and

WHEREAS, on June 9, 2000 this Board
approved Resolution No. 17 authorizing that
the ad valorem taxes that would otherwise be
imposed on subsequent improvements made
to the property at 1541-45 S. Kingshighway
Blvd. owned and occupied by Zein Group
International Inc., a Missouri Corporation dba
Tile and Stone International (the “Developer”)
be fully abated for a period of ten (10) years;
and

WHEREAS, on April 12, 2002 the Land
Clearance for Redevelopment Authority of the
City of St. Louis (“the LCRA”) entered into a
Redevelopment Agreement with the
Developer; and

WHEREAS, the Developer completed
the Subsequent Improvements and the LCRA
issued a Certificate of Completion dated April
22, 2002; and

WHEREAS, approximately two years
after the issuance of the Certificate of
Completion, the Developer expanded the
initial Subsequent Improvements anticipating
that ten (10) years of abatement would also
be granted for the additional Subsequent
Improvements; and

WHEREAS, because the additional
Subsequent Improvements were constructed
on the same parcel as the initial Subsequent
Improvements, no additional abatement was
granted for the additional Subsequent
Improvements; and

WHEREAS, it has been determined that
by granting one additional year of abatement
for all the Subsequent Improvements on the
parcel, the Developer will be justly
compensated for both the initial and additional
Subsequent Improvements made to the
property; and

WHEREAS, Section 135.215 of the
Statute provides that no abatement shall be

granted except upon approval of an
authorizing resolution by the governing
authority having jurisdiction over the EZ area
following a public hearing held by said
governing authority for the purpose of
obtaining the opinions and suggestions of
residents of political subdivision in the area
affected and published in a newspaper of
general circulation in the area to be affected
by the exemption at least twenty (20) days
prior to the hearing but not more than thirty
(30) days prior to the hearing, stating the time,
location, date and purpose of the hearing; and

WHEREAS, such public hearing was
held on the 4th day of December, 2013, notice
of which was given in accordance with the
requirements of the Statutes as described
above, and all interested parties had the
opportunity to be heard at said public hearing.

NOW, THEREFORE, be it resolved by
the St. Louis Board of Aldermen as follows:

1. In addition to the ten (10) year tax
abatement authorized by Resolution No. 17
approved June 9, 2000 by this Board, the
Developer be granted one (1) additional year
of abatement to compensate the Developer
for the construction of an additional
Subsequent Improvement completed
approximately two years after issuance by
the LCRA of the Certificate of Completion
for the initial Subsequent Improvements.

2. For purposes of calculating the tax
liability for the Subsequent Improvements,
any increase in the assessment of any
improvements, from the assessment in effect
for such improvements as of January 1, 2011,
shall be deemed attributable to the Subsequent
Improvements.

3. In accordance with Section 135.215(1)
of the Statute, a copy of this resolution shall
be forwarded to the Director of Missouri
Department of Economic Development within
thirty (30) days of its approval.

part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining
to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the
same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision on the same subject matter;
containing severability clause.

WHEREAS, local businesses which seek
to enter into contracts with the City of St.

businesses from other areas because of the
higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS, by enacting a local
preference law that allows a local firm to match
the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to
encourage and stimulate local business.
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF
ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:
SECTION ONE. Section One, part

A. Proposals shall be opened at the time
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the
presence of such bidders as desire to be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B. The bids shall not be materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more than one local bidder is within two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest

year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as

employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment

City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of

the bid.
C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or any part thereof, but the Board of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.
SECTION THREE. Severability.
The provisions of this section are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can be given effect without the invalid
provision.
