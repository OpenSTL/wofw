WHEREAS, the team of dedicated and
talented staff of Pacific Educational Group

throughout the U.S., Canada and Australia in
fostering the development of greater
awareness, skills and accountability in
educating all students and especially

disparities between White students and
students of color have reached unprecedented,
alarmingly high levels; and

Pacific Educational Group strive to prepare
leaders, be they governing board members,
administrators, teachers, students, parents or
community members, to be effective and

the highest and lowest achievement categories;
and
WHEREAS, the Summit for Courageous
Conversation convenes leaders for racial
equity from the U.S. and around the world to
engage, sustain and deepen interracial dialogue
about the impact of race on schooling and to

of color and their White peers.

RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize Pacific Educational
Group’s Fifth Annual Summit for Courageous
Conversation and we further direct the Clerk

Resolution No. 149
19th Anniversary Celebration for
Pastor Curtis Scott &
Lighthouse Christian Ministry
WHEREAS, Pastor Dorothy J. Scott
and Curtis W. Scott, both were called to become
ministers early in their marriage. They both
served tirelessly over the years as members
of Greater Truevine Spiritual Church as
ministers and teachers of Sunday school. They
were always faithful and true to their ministry
and were always willing and ready to preach
and teach God’s Word whenever and wherever
needed; and

WHEREAS, in 1994 they were led to
open their own church in a little church by the
side of the road at 8026 Ellerton. When they
opened their doors they had half a dozen souls.
They didn’t have an out reach ministry, nor
did they contact friends to join them. They
knew if they unselfishly served God, He would
do the rest. After much prayer and
contemplation they were able to grow and
serve in their small church house with over
twenty five members; and

WHEREAS, in March of 2005; they
were able to relocate to a new church building
located at 3616 Bates. Their ministry grew
even more to over sixty members. Christ said,
“Upon this rock I will build my church and
the gates of hell shall not prevail against it”,
Matthew 16:18. Sadly, three years later Pastor
Dorothy Scott passed away after a long battle
with Leukemia; and

WHEREAS, Pastor Dorothy was and
is still dearly missed, Pastor Curtis Scott
continued as the Lord wanted him to do. The
church went through many changes after her
passing, but the congregation continues to
serve and be a church driven by God. Under
the direction of Pastor Scott the membership
is again on the increase. He never lost sight of
the fact that the most important goal of his
ministry was to bring souls to Christ by the
Word of God. Pastor Scott is celebrating his
19th year as Pastor of Lighthouse Christian

Ministry and also celebrating the 19th year of
the opening of Lighthouse Christian Ministry.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize and congratulate
Pastor Curtis Scott on celebrating nineteen
years of preaching and teaching to and for the
members of Lighthouse Christian Ministry
and we further direct the Clerk of this Board
to spread a copy of this Resolution across the
minutes of these proceedings and to prepare a
commemorative copy to the end that it may
be presented to our honoree at a time and
place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

Board Bill No. 295
Committee Substitute As Amended
An Ordinance repealing Section One,
part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining
to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the
same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision on the same subject matter;
containing severability clause.

WHEREAS, local businesses which seek
to enter into contracts with the City of St.
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with
businesses from other areas because of the
higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS, by enacting a local
preference law that allows a local firm to match
the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to
encourage and stimulate local business.
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF
ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION ONE. Section One, part
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.
SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu
thereof is the following new section.
5.58.040 - Opening of bids.

A. Proposals shall be opened at the time
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the
presence of such bidders as desire to be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B. The bids shall not be materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more than one local bidder is within two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder

means a bidder whose principal place of
business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where a majority (51%) of the full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.
C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or any part thereof, but the Board of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.
SECTION THREE. Severability.
The provisions of this section are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can be given effect without the invalid
provision.

reserved
