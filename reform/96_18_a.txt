            Resolution No. 86                     
       WHEREAS, the Missouri Department           
 of Transportation and St. Louis County have      
 proposed the South County Connector, a           
 limited access roadway project intended to       
 ease the commute between south St. Louis         
 County and Clayton, that has the potential to    
 negatively impact quality of life for residents  
 in the City of St. Louis; and                    
       WHEREAS, a portion of the proposed         
 South County Connector right-of-way runs         
 through an existing park owned by the City       
 of St. Louis and would displace recreational     
 trails; and                                      
       WHEREAS, taxpayers in St. Louis City       
 and County elected to tax themselves to pay      
 for the MetroLink Blue Line expansion that       
 was built along the same corridor as the South   
County Connector with the same goals to               
alleviate traffic congestion and reduce               
automobile reliance regionally; and                   
      WHEREAS, the Draft Environmental                
Impact Study (DEIS) insufficiently analyzes           
the full effects of the proposed limited access       
roadway on the City of St. Louis; and                 
      WHEREAS, City of St. Louis residents,           
in addition to the bordering city of                  
Maplewood, whose city council issued a                
unanimous resolution in opposition to the             
South County Connector project, have                  
expressed overwhelming disfavor for the               
project; and                                          
      WHEREAS, the St Louis Board of                  
Aldermen has an obligation to protect resident        
quality of life, property values, parks and           
green space, and commerce and should seek             
capital improvement projects that advance all         
three.

RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen for                 
the City of St. Louis that we oppose the              
proposed route of the South County                    
Connector and the legitimacy of the draft             
environmental impact statement, which fails           
to provide clear and accurate information             
regarding the impact the highway will have on         
the study area.

 In accordance with Ordinance No. 65597, the

 the City of St. Louis has determined that the   
 following living wage rates are now in effect   
 for employees of covered contracts:             
    1)    Where health benefits as defined in    
          the Ordinance are provided to the      
          employee, the living wage rate is      
          $12.21 per hour (130% of the federal   
          poverty level income guideline for a   
          family of three); and                  
    2)    Where health benefits as defined in    
          the Ordinance are not provided to      
          the employee, the living wage rate is  
          $15.92 per hour (130% of the federal

 These rates are based upon federal poverty

 of the City of St. Louis.

              Board Bill No. 295                 
     Committee Substitute As Amended             
       An Ordinance repealing Section One,       
 part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining      
 to the opening of bids, codified as Section     
 5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of     
 St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the  
 same subject matter which allows a local bidder 
 to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid     
 is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new      
 provision on the same subject matter;           
 containing severability clause.                 
       WHEREAS, local businesses which seek      
 to enter into contracts with the City of St.    
 Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with    
 businesses from other areas because of the      
 higher administrative costs of doing business   
 in the City;                                    
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis             
 desires to encourage businesses to remain in    
 the City and to relocate to the City;           
       WHEREAS, by enacting a local              
 preference law that allows a local firm to match
 the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%        
 percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to    
 encourage and stimulate local business.         
      BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF              
 ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                           
      SECTION ONE. Section One, part             
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.     
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu               
 thereof is the following new section.           
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                
       A. Proposals shall be opened at the time  
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the    
 presence of such bidders as desire to be        
 present, and shall be open to the inspection    
 of bidders.                                     
       B. The bids shall not be materially       
 modified or amended as to price, specification  
 or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon, 
 after opening except when the lowest bid is     
 from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid    
 is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder    
 within two percent of the lowest bid may        
 match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches 
 the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner    
 may select the bid from the local bidder. If    
 more than one local bidder is within two        
 percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest 
 local bidder may match the bid. In all other    
 circumstances, modification, supplementation    
 or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.  
 For purposes of this chapter, local bidder      
 means a bidder whose principal place of         
 business is within the City of St. Louis, has   
 had a valid business license for at least one   
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.  
Principal place of business shall be defined as  
the business's physical office, plant, or site   
where a majority (51%) of the full-time          
employees, chief officer, and managers of the    
business regularly work and conduct business,    
or where the plant or office and equipment       
required for the furnishing of the goods or      
performance of the services provided to the      
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of    
the bid.                                         
      C. Bids may be for one or more or all the  
articles advertised for, but there shall be a    
specific bid on each article. The award may be   
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or    
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition  
or any part thereof, but the Board of            
Standardization may reject any or all bids or    
any part of any bid.                             
     SECTION THREE. Severability.                
      The provisions of this section are         
severable. If any provision of this ordinance    
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not   
affect other provisions of the ordinance which   
can be given effect without the invalid          
provision.                                       
Approved: April 29, 2013                         
     The right to reject any and all bids is     
reserved
