      An Ordinance repealing Section One,         
part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining        
to the opening of bids, codified as Section       
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of       
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the    
same subject matter which allows a local bidder   
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid       
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new        
provision on the same subject matter;             
containing severability clause.                   
      WHEREAS, local businesses which seek        
to enter into contracts with the City of St.      
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with      
businesses from other areas because of the        
higher administrative costs of doing business     
in the City;                                      
     WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis               
desires to encourage businesses to remain in      
the City and to relocate to the City;             
      WHEREAS, by enacting a local                
preference law that allows a local firm to match  
the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%          
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to      
encourage and stimulate local business.           
     BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF                
ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                             
     SECTION ONE. Section One, part               
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.        
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                  
 thereof is the following new section.              
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                   
       A. Proposals shall be opened at the time     
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the       
 presence of such bidders as desire to be           
 present, and shall be open to the inspection       
 of bidders.                                        
       B. The bids shall not be materially          
 modified or amended as to price, specification     
 or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,    
 after opening except when the lowest bid is        
 from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid       
 is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder       
 within two percent of the lowest bid may           
 match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches    
 the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner       
 may select the bid from the local bidder. If       
 more than one local bidder is within two           
 percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest    
 local bidder may match the bid. In all other       
 circumstances, modification, supplementation       
 or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.     
 For purposes of this chapter, local bidder         
 means a bidder whose principal place of            
 business is within the City of St. Louis, has      
 had a valid business license for at least one      
 year, and is current in payment of local taxes.    
 Principal place of business shall be defined as    
 the business's physical office, plant, or site     
 where a majority (51%) of the full-time            
 employees, chief officer, and managers of the      
 business regularly work and conduct business,      
 or where the plant or office and equipment         
 required for the furnishing of the goods or        
 performance of the services provided to the        
 City, as required by the contract, are physically
