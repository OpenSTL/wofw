     Committee Substitute As Amended            
       An Ordinance repealing Section One,      
 part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining     
 to the opening of bids, codified as Section    
 5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of    
 St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the 
 same subject matter which allows a local bidder
 to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid    
 is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new     
 provision on the same subject matter;          
containing severability clause.                    
      WHEREAS, local businesses which seek         
to enter into contracts with the City of St.       
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with       
businesses from other areas because of the         
higher administrative costs of doing business      
in the City;                                       
     WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis                
desires to encourage businesses to remain in       
the City and to relocate to the City;              
      WHEREAS, by enacting a local                 
preference law that allows a local firm to match   
the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%           
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to
