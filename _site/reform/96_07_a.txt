       St. Nicholas All School                        
            Alumni Reunion                            
     WHEREAS, the St. Nicholas All School             
Alumni Reunion, which starts on Friday, May

luncheon on Sunday, May 5, will bring                 
together over 300 graduates, community and            
business leaders and faith leaders to celebrate       
the 130 years that St. Nicholas has served            
downtown St. Louis residents; and                     
      WHEREAS, opened in 1867 by German               
Catholics, the church and school became the           
first and only parish in the city to focus on         
educating and improving the lives of African          
Americans. In 1923, Jesuit scholars took over         
the reigns of the church and built an elementary      
and high school. For years, the church served         
residents of neighboring Carr Square Village          
and Vaugh Apartments. Today, although the             
schools have been closed, the church and a            
preschool continue to serve residents of St.          
Louis including expanded areas that have been         
impacted by other church closures; and                
     WHEREAS, St. Nicholas has a proud                
tradition of excellence and has many                  
distinguished graduates including the                 
 Honorable Congressman William Lacy Clay,           
 Sr. (Ret.), actors Robert                          
 Guillaume and Ken Page, MO State                   
 Representative Penny Gorman Hubbard, TV            
 Host and Legal Expert Areva Martin, Esq.,          
 Dr. James Perkins, and corporate executives        
 Karen Lemmons Bohr (US Airways) and John           
 Nance (3M). The current pastor is Father           
 Urey Patrick Mark; and                             
       WHEREAS, the reunion, themed, "A             
 Time to Remember: Coming Together and              
 Giving Back," will honor the staff, sponsors       
 and alums who served faithfully thousands of       
 residents in the downtown and North St.            
 Louis communities. It will also serve as a         
 fundraiser for the St. Nicholas preschool,         
 which provides quality day care and academic       
 instruction to hundreds of preschool kids each     
 year; and                                          
       WHEREAS, since 1926 St. Nicholas and         
 the St. Louis African American community           
 have grown together and through myriad             
 economic and demographic changes, St.              
 Nicholas continues to provide a haven for          
 worship, council, education and recreation to      
 many. Best known for its famed skating rink,       
 St. Nicholas was "home" to thousands as it         
 provided a safe and nurturing environment          
 replete with the kind of religious instruction     
 that prepared its graduates to blossom and         
 excel.                                             
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                           
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

 continued success, achievement and                 
 accomplishment and we further direct the

move to St. Louis in 1995, and also                
spearheaded the creation of the Forest Park        
Master Plan; and                                   
      WHEREAS, Mayor Bosley understood             
that it takes an operating budget to properly      
run and manage a city like St. Louis. After        
many unsuccessful attempts by the previous         
mayor to pass a sales tax increase to increase     
the city's budget, Freeman Bosley Jr.'s            
popularity in the African American community       
and the goodwill he gained by his management       
of the flood that affected south St. Louis         
allowed him to get sales tax increases passed      
 that provided more funding for capital                
 improvements and the general operating                
 budget. Without those additional funding              
 sources, the city of St. Louis would not be           
 able to provide the level of service that it does     
 today.                                                
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                              
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of                  
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our            
 deliberations to recognize the 20th anniversary       
 of the inauguration of Mayor Freeman R.               
 Bosley Jr. and we wish him continued success,         
 achievement and accomplishment and we

       The Board of Police Commissioners

 to reject any and all bids. The Board also       
 reserves the right to consider criteria other

       Bidders are hereby advised that the St.    
 Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and           
 associated Regulations could apply to the        
 service for which bids are being sought herein.  
 This Ordinance requires that, unless specific    
 exemptions apply, all individuals who perform    
 work pursuant to a contract executed between     
 the successful bidder and the City must be       
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage     
 rates and if rates are adjusted during the term  
 of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,       
 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.  
 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage         
 Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration        
 with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration 
 with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.
 A successful bidder's failure to comply with     
 the contract provisions related to the Living    
 Wage Ordinance may result in termination of      
 the contract and the imposition of additional    
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and        
 Regulations.                                     
       Copies of the Ordinance and Regulations    
 are available upon request from Carol Shepard,   
 at 314-444-5608 or can be accessed at            
 http://www.stlouiscity.com/livingwage.           
      Bidders are also advised that the State     
 of Missouri requires workers on all public       
 works projects to be paid prevailing wages.      
 The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the     
 contracting public body of $100 per day (or      
 portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than  
 the prevailing rate for any work done under      
 the contract by the contractor or by any         
 subcontractor (Section 290.250, RSMo.).          
 Also, if a vendor would like to receive a bid

 the City of St. Louis has determined that the   
 following living wage rates are now in effect   
 for employees of covered contracts:             
    1)    Where health benefits as defined in    
          the Ordinance are provided to the      
          employee, the living wage rate is      
          $12.21 per hour (130% of the federal   
          poverty level income guideline for a   
          family of three); and                  
    2)    Where health benefits as defined in    
          the Ordinance are not provided to      
          the employee, the living wage rate is  
          $15.92 per hour (130% of the federal

 These rates are based upon federal poverty      
 level income guidelines as defined in the
