COURTESY RESOLUTIONS
CONSENT CALENDAR
President Reed introduced Resolutions
No. 64 through 69 and the Clerk was instructed
to read same.

Resolution No. 64
Voices for Children
WHEREAS, the Court Appointed
Special Advocate (CASA) movement began
in 1977 when a Seattle judge became
increasingly frustrated about making decisions
for children of abuse when he didn’t have
enough information. Sadly, the case that
launched the CASA movement involved a child
who died while under custody of the State of
Washington; and
WHEREAS, in 1980, the National
Council of Jewish Women (NCJW) was
granted permission to serve as the lead agency
in piloting a CASA program in St. Louis
County. The organization’s advocacy efforts
proved to be a viable and important part of
the county’s child welfare system and in 1995,
CASA was incorporated as a 501(c)3
organization; and
WHEREAS, St. Louis City’s CASA
program was established in 1984, when the
St. Louis City Family court Established a
Volunteer Guardian ad Litem (VGAL)
program to provide a representative at every
family court hearing for child victims of abuse
and neglect. The work of the VGAL program
was coordinated by the Women’s Crusade
Against Crime; and
WHEREAS, in 1998, at the urging of
the court after the dissolution of the Crusade,
St. Louis City CASA was incorporated as a
501(c)3 organization. St. Louis City CASA
changed its name to Voices for Children in
2005 to better articulate its mission. Over its
30-year history, these two organizations have
helped several thousand kids achieve safety,
stability and a more hopeful future; and
WHEREAS, in July of 2011, the
boards of CASA of St. Louis County and
Voices for Children approved the merger of
the two organizations. This historic decision
followed nearly 18 months of deliberation and
brings the collective resources of both
organizations together to give all St. Louis
foster children a stronger voice.
NOW THEREFORE IT BE
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize Voices for Children
and we further direct the Clerk of this Board
to include a copy of this Resolution in the

minutes of these proceedings and to prepare a
memorial copy for presentation at a time and
place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

education of children; and

WHEREAS, David will be deeply
missed by family, friends, and colleagues.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT

the City of St. Louis that we pause to

Resolution No. 67
ST. ANTHONY OF PADUA CATHOLIC
CHURCH 150TH ANNIVERSARY
WHEREAS, SAINT ANTHONY OF
PADUA CATHOLIC CHURCH is
celebrating its Sesquicentennial anniversary as
a parish at Compton and Meramec in the
Dutchtown neighborhood of South St. Louis;
and
WHEREAS, ST. ANTHONY OF
PADUA CATHOLIC CHURCH was
founded at the invitation of Archbishop Peter
Richard Kenrick by Fr. Servace Altmicks, OSF
and three other Franciscan Friars from Saxony,
Germany to serve the German and English
speaking families — mostly farmers — living
in the Dutchtown area between Sts. Peter &
Paul in Soulard and St. Bonaface in Carondelet,
but today serves many families of great
diversity, including immigrants from
throughout the world in an urban setting; and
WHEREAS, the ambitious mission of
SAINT ANTHONY OF PADUA
CATHOLIC CHURCH today includes
recognition of its place in the community as
the “cornerstone in our changing
neighborhood of south St. Louis” and the work
of the parish reflects the call of St. Francis of
Assisi to “rebuild my Church” and the
simplicity of preaching the true gospel as St.
Anthony of Padua did in 13th century Italy;
and
WHEREAS, the first Mass of the parish
is chronicled as occurring on February 5, 1863
in a small frame house donated by parishioner
John Withnell, and a permanent church in
Gothic style, composed of limestone quarried
from down on S. Broadway off Meramec, was
then built with the cornerstone blessed in 1864;
and
WHEREAS, the “new” current church
building was constructed in Romanesque style
with twin spires that can be seen for miles
atop its hill at Meramec and Michigan,
boasting magnificent stained glass windows
by Emil Frei, including the marvel of modern
electric lights outlining the sacristy on special
occasions, with a cornerstone laid on July 4,
1908, and opening in 1910 with a seating
capacity of 1400 (double that of the old
church) and costing $175,000; and
WHEREAS, the religious mettle of the
parish has been tested on numerous occasions,
including the great fire of April 28, 1994, when
lightning struck the church, setting the roof
on fire; the building survived the blaze and
subsequent water damage, and restoration was
immediately undertaken at the direction of

Cardinal Justin Rigali who witnessed the fire;
Christmas Mass was celebrated in the church
building in 1995 and full restoration was
complete in April 1996; and

WHEREAS, members of the parish have
always taken upon themselves the corporal
works of caring for their neighbors through
such efforts as the St. Vincent DePaul Society,
food panty, and other programs.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen for
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the 150th year
anniversary of ST. ANTHONY OF PADUA
CATHOLIC CHURCH and to thank the
members of this historic Church for their many
contributions to the City of St. Louis, and we
direct the Clerk of the Board to prepare a

Resolution No. 68

The Apostles of the Sacred Heart of
Jesus Centennial Celebration
WHEREAS, the Apostles of the Sacred
Heart of Jesus, an international congregation
of Catholic sisters, announce the 100th
anniversary of the arrival of their order in St.
Louis; and

WHEREAS, the year 2013 marks the
100th anniversary of the arrival of the Apostles
of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in St. Louis,
Missouri. Five Sisters journeyed from
Connecticut to this Midwestern city for the
same reason the Apostles had traveled to the
U.S. from Italy in 1902: to serve Italian
immigrants who were struggling and to preserve
their Catholic, moral, and cultural life in the
“New World”; and

WHEREAS, Fr. Cesar Spigardi, Pastor
of Our Lady Help of Christians, or “the Italian
Church” as it was deemed, reached out to the
Apostles whom he had met while giving a
mission in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1912.
He saw in the Sisters the zeal and charity
necessary to help him renew the faith of his
flock. The Apostles arrived in St. Louis on
January 24, 1913, and began teaching in the
new parish school, educating the Italian
immigrant children, evangelizing, and
providing pastoral care to their families. From
downtown, the Sisters’ mission expanded to

Sacred Heart Villa on the Hill in 1940 and St.
Ambrose School in 1941; and

WHEREAS, the Apostles began
ministering at Our Lady of Good Counsel in
North County in 1953 and built Cor Jesu
Academy in Affton in 1965. For the past 100
years, the Apostles of the Sacred Heart of
Jesus have served in more than 35 schools,
parishes, and other ministries in the greater
St. Louis area; and

WHEREAS, the centennial celebration
will begin with a Mass of Thanksgiving on
Sunday, June 30, 2013 at St. Francis Xavier
College Church with Archbishop Robert J.
Carson as celebrant. There will be a reception
immediately following the Mass in the Xavier
Grand Ballroom.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the Apostles of the
Sacred Heart of Jesus Centennial Celebration
and we further direct the Clerk of this Board
to spread a copy of this Resolution across the
minutes of these proceedings and to prepare a
commemorative copy to the end that it may
be presented to our honorees at a time and
place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

outside of Bosnia, provided an opportunity
for Team 222 to gain a cultural understanding
of Eastern Europe here in the United States;
WHEREAS, Civil Affairs Team 222

partnered with the City’s Emergency
