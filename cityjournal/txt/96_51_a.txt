in the United States Cadet Nurse Corps at St.
Mary’s Infirmary in St. Louis; soon after in
1946 she became one of the first three African-

American women to join the Sisters of Mary
(now the Franciscan Sisters of Mary). In 1962,
she earned a degree in medical records
administration and two years later she earned

“called to be a Moses to the people.” Five
universities have awarded her honorary

expression, “Give God the glory and give her
the prayers.”

FIRST READING OF
RESOLUTIONS

Ms. Ingrassia introduced Resolution No.
235 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 235

“Right to Work”
WHEREAS, many hard-working
families in the United States are in a constant
struggle to meet basic financial needs and goals;
and

WHEREAS, America has a growing
problem with income inequality, as the
wealthiest one-percent thrive while millions
of others are struggling, earning less and losing
jobs; and

WHEREAS, a few lawmakers and outof-state corporate special interest groups see
the current economic climate as an
opportunity to revive an old, outdated and
dangerous ideology known as Right to Work;
and

WHEREAS, these out-of-state
corporate special interests are targeting
Missouri to lower wages and cut benefits for
middle class families so they can increase
corporate profits even more; and

WHEREAS, a handful of Missouri’s
elected officials have introduced Right to Work
legislation in the state Capitol, with the hopes

of turning Missouri into a Right to Work state;
and

WHEREAS, so-called Right to Work
legislation results in a race to the bottom and
has been proven to be a failed idea -creating
lower wages, an unskilled labor force,
diminished pensions and health coverage, lost
jobs, higher poverty rates and decreased
spending on education; and

WHEREAS, enacting laws to lower
wages and benefits for all workers in order to
lure low-paying jobs to the state is not a sound
economic plan for Missouri, and in particular
the City of St. Louis; and

WHEREAS, the total economic loss if
Missouri becomes a Right to Work state would
be devastating; and

WHEREAS, government, companies,
employees and labor unions should be
working together to create good jobs and safe
work places and the proposed Right to Work
legislation does not meet that end; and

WHEREAS, unnecessary Right to Work
legislation is a distraction to the real issues
facing our great city and our great state;

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we oppose so-called
“Right to Work” proposals that would harm
Missouri’s families and threaten the
livelihoods of working men and women
throughout the City of St. Louis and the state
of Missouri.

Board Bill No. 295
Committee Substitute As Amended

part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining
to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the
same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision on the same subject matter;
containing severability clause.

WHEREAS, local businesses which seek
to enter into contracts with the City of St.
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with
businesses from other areas because of the
higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS, by enacting a local
preference law that allows a local firm to match
the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to
encourage and stimulate local business.
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF
ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION ONE. Section One, part
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.
SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu
thereof is the following new section.
5.58.040 - Opening of bids.

A. Proposals shall be opened at the time
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the
presence of such bidders as desire to be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B. The bids shall not be materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches

the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more than one local bidder is within two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder
means a bidder whose principal place of
business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where a majority (51%) of the full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.
C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or any part thereof, but the Board of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.
SECTION THREE. Severability.
The provisions of this section are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can be given effect without the invalid
provision.
Approved: April 29, 2013
The right to reject any and all bids is
reserved
